Dlrs. Results will be\\r\\nannounced on Tuesday. The 1985 net profit was 2.72 billion.\\r\\n    They forecast a final dividend of 29 cents for a total of\\r\\n42 cents for the year against 38 cents in 1985, adjusted for a\\r\\none-for-five bonus issue.\\r\\n    Analysts said they expected the bank to recommend a bonus\\r\\nissue this year, probably one for three or one for five.\\r\\n    The banks 61.5 pct subsidiary Hang Seng Bank Ltd &lt;HSGH.HK>\\r\\nis to report its 1986 results on Friday.\\r\\n    Analysts expect Hang Seng to announce net profit of more\\r\\nthan one billion dlrs for the first time, an increase of 10 to\\r\\n12 pct.\\r\\n    They expect Hang Seng to pay a final dividend of 1.37 dlrs\\r\\nfor a total of 1.75 dlrs for the year against 1.60 in 1985.\\r\\n    Analysts said that while the use of undisclosed inner\\r\\nreserves by banks here makes forecasting very imprecise,\\r\\nHongkong Bank benefited from the unexpected strength of the\\r\\nHong Kong economy in 1986, when gross domestic product grew by\\r\\nnearly nine pct against an initial forecast of 4.5 pct.\\r\\n    They benefited considerably from the pickup in loan demand,\\r\\nas their loan portfolio is well balanced, an analyst at Mansion\\r\\nHouse Securities (F.E.) Ltd said.\\r\\n    Government figures show that total loans and advances rose\\r\\nby 13.8 pct in 1986, compared with a 4.5 pct increase in 1985.\\r\\n    Loans to finance Hong Kongs visible trade, the mainstay of\\r\\nthe local economy, rose by 15.1 pct against a decline of five\\r\\npct in 1985.\\r\\n    Low interest rates also helped the bank. Interest received\\r\\non loans was low, with the prime rate at 6.5 pct at end-1986,\\r\\nbut interest paid on savings was two pct. Hongkong Bank and\\r\\nHang Seng Bank control half of all deposits in the banking\\r\\nsystem, giving them access to a large base of low-cost funds.\\r\\n    The strength of the real-estate market was another major\\r\\nincome source for the bank group. Loans to finance property\\r\\ndevelopment and instalment mortgages rose sharply.\\r\\n    The Hongkong Bank group is still the leader in mortgage\\r\\nbusiness despite tough competition from the Bank of China group\\r\\nand other foreign banks, one analyst said.\\r\\n    The high level of activity on the capital and equities\\r\\nmarkets in 1986 contributed to a sharp improvement in Hongkong\\r\\nBank subsidiaries Wardley Ltd &lt;WAIA.HK> and &lt;James Capel and\\r\\nCo>, analysts said. Wardley had a tremendous year acting as\\r\\nfinancial adviser and underwriter, an analyst said.\\r\\n    Wardley was underwriter for last years billion-dlr\\r\\nflotation of &lt;Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd>, of which Hongkong\\r\\nBank owned 30 pct at the time.\\r\\n    The banks stake has since been cut to 16.4 pct in return\\r\\nfor 1.57 billion dlrs. It also sold its entire 48.8 pct stake\\r\\nin &lt;South China Morning Post Ltd>, the larger of two\\r\\nEnglish-language daily newspapers here, for 1.18 billion dlrs.\\r\\n    The proceeds will go to reserves for acquisitions and will\\r\\nnot show up in the profit and loss accounts, analysts said.\\r\\n    Analysts said the bank had also been helped by a reduced\\r\\nneed to write off bad debts. The need for provisions was much\\r\\nlower than the year before, said Tony Measor of Hong Leong\\r\\nSecurities Co Ltd. Last years profits should have been 2.8 to\\r\\n2.9 billion dlrs if not for the huge provisions.\\r\\n    Former Hongkong Bank chairman Michael Sandberg said the\\r\\nbank wrote off hundreds of millions of dollars against its\\r\\nshipping exposure in 1985. Lesley Nickolds of County Securities\\r\\nAsia Ltd said she saw no major shipping writeoffs in 1986.

The agreement\\r\\nsimply helped it on its way. Senior EC financial expert in\\r\\nTokyo Tomas de Hora has watched the movements closely.\\r\\n    You have to look at the dollars peak compared with now,\\r\\nand that was well before Plaza, he said.\\r\\n    On February 25, 1985, the dollar peaked against the yen at\\r\\n263.15 yen. On September 20, the Friday before Plaza, it was\\r\\n242. Since then, despite massive Bank of Japan intervention and\\r\\nperiodic market frights about further G-5 concerted action, the\\r\\ndollar trend has been down, down, down.\\r\\n    Yet the ECU is now around 173.4 yen. The historical cross\\r\\nrates for sterling and the mark tell much the same story. The\\r\\nEuropean currencies are moving back up against the yen.\\r\\n    The close relationship between exchange rates and trade\\r\\nflows makes it difficult to see which is driving which, but\\r\\nundoubtedly the trade equation between the big three is\\r\\nchanging. In 1986, Japanese imports and exports with the EC\\r\\nboth grew by around 50 pct in dollar terms, five pct in yen.\\r\\nThis gave Japan a 16 billion dlr trade surplus.\\r\\n    Last January, Japanese exports to the EC totalled half of\\r\\nof sales to the U.S, against about a third in recent years.\\r\\n    Trade with the U.S in 1986 rose 23 pct for exports and 12\\r\\npct for imports in dollar terms, but fell 13 pct for exports\\r\\nand 21 pct for imports in yen terms.\\r\\n    The basic meaning for Europe is that Japanese firms have a\\r\\ntremendous interest in exporting to Europe, where every unit\\r\\nsold maximises profits in yen terms, which is what is important\\r\\nto them. Suddenly, instead of the U.S., It is Europe that is\\r\\nlaying the golden egg, said de Hora.\\r\\n    The EC is worried. EC business also had a remarkable year\\r\\nin Japanese sales, but this can be explained partly due to its\\r\\nstart from a small base, compared with total Japan-U.S. Trade.\\r\\n    The Japanese think EC firms are now more competitive than\\r\\nU.S. Firms, a factor which is aggravating the exchange rate\\r\\nimbalance, and which will cause problems.\\r\\n    This currency alignment between Japan and the EC is\\r\\nreflecting the excellent performance of the EC countries. But\\r\\ntherefore, Japanese goods may keep their price competitive\\r\\nedge, said Azusa Hayashi, Director of the First International\\r\\nEconomic Affairs Division of the Foreign Ministry.

Its an illusion based on a\\r\\nmisunderstanding of Western economy.\\r\\n    Theres a limit to how much you can go on giving someone\\r\\nwho has no hope of repaying it, another said, adding that\\r\\nPoland had benefited from a global phenomenon of easy credits\\r\\nin the 1970s which were no longer todays reality.\\r\\n    Describing the 15 billion dlr assessment as nebulous, one\\r\\ndiplomat said it also included losses of hypothetical orders\\r\\nand setbacks to Polish research through the curbing of\\r\\nscientific links and exchanges.  Western officials say the\\r\\nlifting of sanctions and new MFN status will have little impact\\r\\non Poland, which has a hard currency debt of 33.5 billion dlrs\\r\\nand lacks the means to modernise its industry.\\r\\n    MFN doesnt really mean anything, only that Poland will not\\r\\nbe treated worse than other countries. It will be difficult to\\r\\nregain access to the U.S. Market because different forces are\\r\\nin play now, said one Western envoy.\\r\\n    He said Polish products were not competitive, and their\\r\\nquality was too low. Trade wars and possible protectionist\\r\\nmeasures amongst the U.S., Japan and Europe would also hamper\\r\\nPolands efforts to regain entry.\\r\\n    Deputy foreign trade minister Janusz Kaczurba recognised\\r\\nthis fact recently.\\r\\n    Kaczurba told the official PAP news agency recently, Making\\r\\nup our lost position will take a long time and be uncommonly\\r\\ndifficult, and in certain cases impossible... In a period of\\r\\ntwo to three years it will be possible to increase the level of\\r\\nexports by only about 100 mln dlrs.\\r\\n    While Poland is unlikely to seek compensation, it says it\\r\\nhas a moral right to assistance from the U.S. Which it says\\r\\nimposed the sanctions illegally. But a Western economist said\\r\\nThe argument that U.S. Sanctions were a unilateral torpedoing\\r\\nof the Polish economy wont cut any ice. The Americans will\\r\\njust reply that the Poles acted immorally in crushing\\r\\nSolidarity.\\r\\n    Nevertheless, Polish National Bank head Wladyslaw Baka, in\\r\\ntalks in Washington last week with the International Monetary\\r\\nFund (IMF) and World Bank, made it clear that Poland was\\r\\nlooking for a lead from the United States.\\r\\n    He was quoted by PAP as saying that Poland would meet its\\r\\nfinancial obligations to the United States, but not in a short\\r\\ntime and not without a cooperative stand on the part of its\\r\\nforeign economic partners.\\r\\n    He stressed that the U.S. had a particular opportunity to\\r\\nplay a part in the cooperative policy of Polands partners\\r\\ninterested in the settlement of Polish debt.\\r\\n    Putting it more sharply, one senior banking official blamed\\r\\nWashington for obstructing talks with the World Bank, IMF and\\r\\nParis Club of Western creditor governments in recent years and\\r\\nsaid it should now play a more positive role.\\r\\n    As a major superpower the United States can influence\\r\\ninternational organisations, he said, citing recent meetings\\r\\naimed at stabilising currencies as an example of the extent to\\r\\nwhich Western nations were prepared to cooperate.\\r\\n REUTER\\r\\n&#3;\\',0\\r\\n\\'U.K. FOURTH QUARTER TRADE DEFICIT 2.6 BILLION STG Britain had a visible trade deficit of\\r\\n2.6 billion stg in the fourth quarter of 1986 against a revised\\r\\ndeficit of 2.9 billion in the third quarter, official\\r\\nstatistics show.\\r\\n    Seasonally-adjusted figures issued by the Central\\r\\nStatistical Office (CSO) show the current account was in\\r\\ndeficit by 760 mln stg against an upwardly revised third\\r\\nquarter shortfall of 930 mln.\\r\\n    For 1986 as a whole, visible trade was in deficit by 8.3\\r\\nbillion stg, sharply up from 1985s 2.2.

Analysts noted that a\\r\\ngeneral collapse in exploration and production volumes was\\r\\npartially offset by earnings from chemicals rising to 462 mln\\r\\nstg from 205 mln in 1985.\\r\\n    Also, a windfall tax credit and lower than expected\\r\\ncurrency losses had added about 100 mln stg onto fourth quarter\\r\\nresults, which was the main reason for the figures exceeding\\r\\nforecasts, industry analyst Chris Rowland of Barclays de Zoete\\r\\nWedd noted.\\r\\n    However, he added there could well be a sharp fall in\\r\\nperformance in the first quarter of 1987, due to the\\r\\nimprobability that the group would be able to repeat the high\\r\\nrefining and marketing margins of first quarter 1986.\\r\\n    The impact of recovering oil prices would come through\\r\\nfaster on the downstream side than on the upstream as such a\\r\\nhigh proportion of upstream activity centred on gas, which\\r\\ntypically reacted to oil price changes with about a half-year\\r\\nlag, analysts said.\\r\\n    Holmes said that in the upstream U.S. Sector the third\\r\\nquarter of 1986 had been the worst of all.\\r\\n    Only two of the oil majors had managed to make a profit in\\r\\nthe period, with Shell Oil being one of them. The decrease in\\r\\nU.S. Earnings had been accentuated by tax rates but the group\\r\\nhad increased share to become volume market leader, Holmes\\r\\nadded.\\r\\n    Continued low crude oil prices would continue to subdue\\r\\nU.S. Exploration activity. Exploration is currently pretty\\r\\nflat. We are going to go on, but at 16-18 dlrs there will be no\\r\\nmassive upturn, he said.\\r\\n    A renewal of exploration in high cost areas of the North\\r\\nSea and the U.S. Requires prices of around 25 dlrs a barrel.\\r\\n    Ultimately this would lead to a rise in U.S. Imports. If\\r\\nyou are not exploring you are not going to find anything, he\\r\\nnoted.\\r\\n    U.S. Oil production had dropped some half mln barrels a day\\r\\n(bbd) in 1986 and would continue to fall if the price stayed\\r\\nbelow 20 dlrs a barrel.\\r\\n    This favored OPECs attempts to stabilise prices, as the\\r\\nlower the price the more likelihood there was of non-OPEC\\r\\nmarginal production shutting down. OPEC has done pretty\\r\\nextraordinarily well...Everything is moving in (its) direction,\\r\\nhe added.\\r\\n Reuter\\r\\n&#3;\\',0\\r\\n\\'BANKERS WELCOME SPANISH RESERVE REQUIREMENT HIKE Bankers welcomed the Bank of Spains\\r\\ndecision to raise the reserve requirement for banks and savings\\r\\nbanks, saying it reflected the socialist governments\\r\\ndetermination not to ease up in the fight against inflation\\r\\ndespite the painful social effects of four years of austerity.\\r\\n    The central bank last night raised the requirement by one\\r\\npercentage point to 19 pct from March 13, saying that excess\\r\\nliquidity threatened money supply and inflation targets.\\r\\n    Bankers said the move represented a change of tactic by the\\r\\nBank, which until now has relied on raising interest rates to\\r\\nchoke off money supply growth.\\r\\n    I think its a good measure, a senior foreign banker said.\\r\\nIts a faster way to get the job done than using interest rates\\r\\nand avoids unpleasant effects on other areas of the economy.\\r\\n    It shows that the political will is very strong. They know\\r\\nthat controlling inflation will make industry more competitive\\r\\nand bring down unemployment in the long run, he added.\\r\\n    The head of another foreign bank said that only a month\\r\\nago, the Bank of Spain had dismissed his suggestion of a rise\\r\\nin reserve requirements, preferring to pursue its strategy of\\r\\nraising interest rates.\\r\\n    But bankers said the high real interest rates on offer now\\r\\n-- around eight pct for overnight funds -- was attracting money\\r\\nfrom abroad, strengthening the peseta and making Spanish\\r\\nexports less competitive.\\r\\n    The government says industrys competitiveness is also\\r\\nbeing hit hard by inflation. At 8.3 pct last year, the rate was\\r\\nway above that of Spains major trading partners in the\\r\\nEuropean Community, which it joined a year ago.\\r\\n    To help meet this years target of five pct, it is\\r\\ninsisting pay rises stay at that level, setting the stage for\\r\\nclashes with trade unions, who say they have made enough\\r\\nsacrifices.\\r\\n    Demonstrations by workers, students and farmers, whose\\r\\ndemands essentially involve more government spending, have\\r\\nbecome an almost daily occurrence. But Prime Minister Felipe\\r\\nGonzalez insists that the state is doing as much as it can.\\r\\n    Bankers said the reserve requirement increase could have\\r\\nsome impact on commercial lending rates but should not hit the\\r\\nmoney market too hard.\\r\\n    The Bank of Spain, which only yesterday raised its key\\r\\novernight call money rate to 13.5 pct, left it unchanged at\\r\\ntodays auction. The rate has been increased nine times since\\r\\nthe start of the year, when it was below 12 pct.\\r\\n    Bankers said commercial lending rates were set to rise in\\r\\nany case with the end of the six pct maximium interest rate\\r\\nbanks can offer for time deposits of up to six months.\\r\\n    The measure will take effect tomorrow, following the\\r\\npublication of the decree in todays official gazette. Bankers\\r\\nsay the liberalisation will increase the cost of funds and,\\r\\ninevitably, push lending rates higher.\\r\\n    A companion measure, reducing the proportion of funds which\\r\\nbanks must invest in specific areas, also takes effect\\r\\ntomorrow.

The\\r\\nstatement said only that the reduction in total supplies,\\r\\nnamely actual exports of crude oil and products, plus local\\r\\ndeliveries in member countries, is even more pronounced as\\r\\nthose supplies fell very noticeably during that month.\\r\\n    No matter what the pressure on member countries by lifters\\r\\nto align the official selling price to the ongoing

The very recent improvement in the price structure is an\\r\\nindicator of such determination by the organization to stick to\\r\\nthe official selling price, the statement said.\\r\\n    Free spot

Two of those victims died and half the\\r\\nvictims in their study of 45 patients had to be hospitalized\\r\\nfor their illness.\\r\\n    They also discovered that cooking the meat didnt always\\r\\nprevent the disease.

But by\\r\\nthen sterling should be firm enough to satisfy even the Bank of\\r\\nEngland, he added.\\r\\n    The Bank declined to comment on its reasons for resisting\\r\\npressure for a rate move before the budget, but banking sources\\r\\nsaid the authorities see the recent rise in sterling as more\\r\\nthan just marking up by foreign exchange traders.\\r\\n    Meanwhile, analysts noted the market ignored potentially\\r\\nharmful news on the trade front, todays figures showing that\\r\\nthe current account deficit in 1986 was 1.1 billion stg.\\r\\n    This was above previous estimates of the current account\\r\\ndeficit and compares with a surplus of 2.9 billion stg in 1985.\\r\\n    Fellner said that under more normal conditions this would\\r\\nhave given the bond and currency markets a pause, but that they\\r\\nwere too bullish to worry about such fundamentals.\\r\\n    The guessing game over the timing of a cut has the clearing\\r\\nbanks divided as well as the markets.

against 43 mln in 1985.\\r\\n    Libras net worth increased by 24 pct to 134 mln stg last\\r\\nyear, and Belmont said the improvement to the banks balance\\r\\nsheet was due to profits being mostly retained in the bank, and\\r\\nto the issue of 10 mln stg of cumulative redeemable preference\\r\\nshares during the year.\\r\\n    Libra is a consortium bank --National Westminster Bank

The agreement\\r\\nsimply helped it on its way. Senior EC financial expert in\\r\\nTokyo Tomas de Hora has watched the movements closely.\\r\\n    You have to look at the dollars peak compared with now,\\r\\nand that was well before Plaza, he said.\\r\\n    On February 25, 1985, the dollar peaked against the yen at\\r\\n263.15 yen. On September 20, the Friday before Plaza, it was\\r\\n242. Since then, despite massive Bank of Japan intervention and\\r\\nperiodic market frights about further G-5 concerted action, the\\r\\ndollar trend has been down, down, down.\\r\\n    Yet the ECU is now around 173.4 yen. The historical cross\\r\\nrates for sterling and the mark tell much the same story. The\\r\\nEuropean currencies are moving back up against the yen.\\r\\n    The close relationship between exchange rates and trade\\r\\nflows makes it difficult to see which is driving which, but\\r\\nundoubtedly the trade equation between the big three is\\r\\nchanging. In 1986, Japanese imports and exports with the EC\\r\\nboth grew by around 50 pct in dollar terms, five pct in yen.\\r\\nThis gave Japan a 16 billion dlr trade surplus.\\r\\n    Last January, Japanese exports to the EC totalled half of\\r\\nof sales to the U.S, against about a third in recent years.\\r\\n    Trade with the U.S in 1986 rose 23 pct for exports and 12\\r\\npct for imports in dollar terms, but fell 13 pct for exports\\r\\nand 21 pct for imports in yen terms.\\r\\n    The basic meaning for Europe is that Japanese firms have a\\r\\ntremendous interest in exporting to Europe, where every unit\\r\\nsold maximises profits in yen terms, which is what is important\\r\\nto them. Suddenly, instead of the U.S., It is Europe that is\\r\\nlaying the golden egg, said de Hora.\\r\\n    The EC is worried. EC business also had a remarkable year\\r\\nin Japanese sales, but this can be explained partly due to its\\r\\nstart from a small base, compared with total Japan-U.S. Trade.\\r\\n    The Japanese think EC firms are now more competitive than\\r\\nU.S. Firms, a factor which is aggravating the exchange rate\\r\\nimbalance, and which will cause problems.\\r\\n    This currency alignment between Japan and the EC is\\r\\nreflecting the excellent performance of the EC countries. But\\r\\ntherefore, Japanese goods may keep their price competitive\\r\\nedge, said Azusa Hayashi, Director of the First International\\r\\nEconomic Affairs Division of the Foreign Ministry. If you want\\r\\nmy objective view, I dont expect a drastic improvement in our\\r\\ntrade imbalance.

The bill would allow farmers to forego planting and\\r\\nstill receive 92 pct of deficiency payments.\\r\\n    The administration has strongly urged that the bill be\\r\\nexpanded to feedgrains and to more than one year.\\r\\n    It is difficult to tell in what form the 0/92 provision\\r\\nwill emerge from the committee, the sources said.\\r\\n    Proponents of an expansion of 0/92 maintain there are large\\r\\nestimated cost savings of such a bill -- ranging from estimates\\r\\nby the administration of 200 to 500 mln dlrs.\\r\\n    Opposition to a reopening of the 1985 farm bill at this\\r\\ntime is the major reason cited by those against an expansion of\\r\\nthe bill, committee staffers said.\\r\\n    The 0/92 plan is scheduled to be discussed at 1530 EST. A\\r\\nconflicting floor vote delayed the start of the meeting, and\\r\\nstaffers said it may have to be delayed even until next week.\\r\\n    Such a delay would not bode well for proponents of an\\r\\nexpanded 0/92 program, since spring planting in many areas of\\r\\nthe country will be underway in the next few weeks and signup\\r\\nfor the 1987 wheat and feedgrains program ends March 30.\\r\\n    Farmers are now making their planting decisions, so\\r\\nsomething has to be done quickly if a 0/92 program is to be\\r\\nimplemented, an Agriculture Department source said.\\r\\n    An expansion of 0/92 to feedgrains was opposed in last\\r\\nweeks subcommittee hearing on the bill, with subcommittee\\r\\nchairman Dan Glickman, D-Kan., saying that more study of the\\r\\nconsequences of decoupling on feedgrains plantings was\\r\\nnecessary.\\r\\n    Major commodity groups, including the National Corn\\r\\nGrowers, the American Farm Bureau and the National Cattlemens\\r\\nAssociation, have voiced strong opposition to 0/92.\\r\\n    But proponents of an expanded 0/92 argue that the bill\\r\\ncurrently is not equitable for all grains producers, so it\\r\\nshould be extended to other crops.\\r\\n    There will be difficulty in limiting 0/92 to wheat, said\\r\\nGene Moos, aide to house majority leader Tom Foley, D-Wash.\\r\\n    Projected cost savings, in the current atmosphere of try to\\r\\ndecrease farm expenditures, would also be hard to ignore in the\\r\\ndebate to expand the 0/92 application, Moos said.\\r\\n    Rep. Charles Stenholm, D-Tex., may be planning to introduce\\r\\na bill to restrict 0/92 to only 1987 crop wheat, with the\\r\\nargument that now is not the time to vote in favor of any major\\r\\nchanges in the farm bill.\\r\\n    Stenholms bill is not a rejection of 0/92, only of the\\r\\ntiming, a congressional staff member said.\\r\\n    Rep.

The move complicated a USAir\\r\\ntakeover offer for Piedmont, which was believed to be close to\\r\\naccepting the bid.\\r\\n    Today, USAir rejected Icahns 52 dlr per share offer and\\r\\nsaid the bid was a last-minute effort to interfere in its\\r\\ntakeover of Piedmont.

USAir fell 1-3/8 to 47-3/4 as doubt spread\\r\\nit would be taken over.\\r\\n    Analysts and market sources view the TWA bid as an attempt\\r\\nto either trigger a counter offer from USAir or to attract a\\r\\nsuitor who might want both airlines once they merged.\\r\\n   The next move is either Icahn starts a tender offer or\\r\\nPiedmont and USAir announce a deal, speculated one arbitrager.\\r\\n    Some arbitragers said there is now some risk in the current\\r\\nprice of Piedmont since it is not clear that USAirs bid will\\r\\nsucceed.\\r\\n    Piedmonts largest shareholder and other suitor, Norfolk\\r\\nSouthern Corp &lt;NSC> has offered 65 dlrs per share for the\\r\\ncompany. USAir offered 71 dlrs cash per share for half of\\r\\nPiedmont stock, and 73 dlrs per share in stock for the balance.\\r\\n    Some arbitragers, however, believe the depressed price of\\r\\nPiedmont offers a buying opportunity since the airline is\\r\\ndestined to be acquired by someone. USAir, they said, is the\\r\\nleast likely to be bought.\\r\\n    Icahn, who has long talked about further consolidation in\\r\\nthe airline industry, also offered USAir the alternative of a\\r\\nthree-way airline combination, including TWA and Piedmont.\\r\\n    But Wall Street has given little credibility to Icahns\\r\\noffer, which lacked financing and was riddled with\\r\\ncontingencies.\\r\\n    Still, he has succeeded in holding up a merger of two\\r\\nairlines - both of which analysts said would fit well with TWA.\\r\\n    You cant discount him, said one arbitrager.\\r\\n    Analysts, however, said Icahn would have to prove he is\\r\\nserious by following through with his threats or making a new\\r\\noffer. In making the offer for USAir, Icahn threatened to go\\r\\ndirectly to shareholders for 51 pct of the stock at a lower\\r\\nprice if USAir rejected his offer.\\r\\n    Its clear Icahn wants to sell and hes bluffing, said\\r\\none arbitrager.\\r\\n    Analysts said the 52 dlr per share offer was underpriced by\\r\\nabout six dlrs per share.\\r\\n    Some analysts believe Icahns proposed three-way airline\\r\\ncombination might face insurmountable regulatory hurdles, but\\r\\nothers believe it could be cleared if the companies are\\r\\nacquired separately.\\r\\n    TWA would have to be the surviving company for the deal to\\r\\nwork, said one analyst.\\r\\n    Analysts said such a merger would be costly and\\r\\ncomplicated. TWA has the best cost structure, since Icahn\\r\\nsucceeded in winning concessions from its unions.\\r\\n    In order for the other carriers to come down to TWAs wage\\r\\nscale in a merger, TWA would have to be the surviving entity,\\r\\nanalysts said.\\r\\n    Such a move does not necessarily free Icahn of TWA, they\\r\\nsaid. They said he showed skill in reducing Ozark Airlines\\r\\ncosts when he merged it into TWA last year, and he might be a\\r\\nnecessary ingredient for a merger to work.\\r\\n    However, other analysts speculated the managements of\\r\\nPiedmont and USAir would not tolerate Icahn as head of a new\\r\\ncompany. They said a USAir acquisition of TWA might be a way\\r\\nfor him to exit the company if USAirs airline is then merged\\r\\ninto TWA.\\r\\n Reuter\\r\\n&#3;\\',0\\r\\n\\'BAKER INTL &lt;BKO> HOPES TO COMPLETE MERGER Baker International Corp treasurer Eric\\r\\nMattson said the company hoped to iron out snags in a proposed\\r\\nmerger with Hughes Tool Co &lt;HT> but declined to say if or what\\r\\ncompromises might be acceptable to it.\\r\\n    The proposed merger that would create a 1.2 billion dlr\\r\\noilfield services company was thrown into limbo yesterday when\\r\\nHughes management, balking at the terms of a government consent\\r\\ndecree, offered a counter-proposal to Baker.\\r\\n    Earlier today, Hughes adjourned a shareholders meeting\\r\\ncalled to vote on the proposed merger until March 11 and said\\r\\nit hoped to resume negotitations with Baker.\\r\\n    Hughes chairman W.A.

But there is no\\r\\nway they can trade their way out of this situation, Aldo\\r\\nRoldan, Vice President for International Services at Chase\\r\\nEconometrics, said.\\r\\n    Roldan told Reuters that Brazil not only had to tackle the\\r\\nproblems of satisfying domestic demand and competing on glutted\\r\\nworld markets, but also had to work to make its position on\\r\\nforeign exchange markets more profitable.\\r\\n    Domestic costs have increased (due to inflation) and\\r\\nexporters have not had the same offsetting movement in exchange\\r\\nrates, Roldan said.\\r\\n    The Chase economist also said commodities markets were\\r\\ndepressed and generally did not appear very promising for a\\r\\ncountry like Brazil, where pure commodities account for some 50\\r\\npct of exports and in 1986 had a total value of around 23\\r\\nbillion dlrs.\\r\\n    But he added: They are always pretty aggressive and they\\r\\nhave good foreign marketing channels.\\r\\n    Analysts said a key factor in Brazilian trade will be\\r\\ncoffee, and even without background pressure from foreign\\r\\ncreditors the worlds largest producer was expected to hit the\\r\\nmarket this year with a vengeance.\\r\\n    Negotiations between International Coffee Organization\\r\\n(ICO) members to re-establish producer export quotas broke up\\r\\nearlier this week with major producers and consumers accusing\\r\\neach other of intransigence.\\r\\n    Brazil would not tolerate a change in ICO regulations,\\r\\nwhich others wanted changed, one senior coffee dealer said.\\r\\n    The dealer, who declined to be named, said Brazil wanted to\\r\\npreserve its market share. At the end of the talks, he said\\r\\nBrazil hinted it could sell more than anyone else and others\\r\\nwould suffer.\\r\\n    Brazil will be an aggressive seller under any scenario but\\r\\nas yet there is no sign of unusually heavy Brazilian sales, the\\r\\ndealer said.\\r\\n    If they do come into the market at this level it will go\\r\\nlower and you could breach a dollar, ninety or eighty cents,\\r\\nhe said.\\r\\n    New York coffee futures for May delivery settled 2.29 cents\\r\\nlower Thursday at 104.68 cents a lb, while more distant\\r\\ndeliveries fell the six-cent maximum trading limit.\\r\\n    President of the Brazilian Coffee Institute, Jorio Dauster\\r\\ntold a press conference in Rio de Janeiro today that Brazil has\\r\\nno set target for its coffee exports following the breakdown of\\r\\nthe ICO talks on export quotas.\\r\\n    Many economists and analysts believe soybeans could be the\\r\\nfocus of possible stepped-up Brazilian marketing efforts. They\\r\\nwill be more aggressive this year than they have ever been,\\r\\naccording to Richard Loewy, analyst for Prudential-Bache\\r\\nSecurities Inc.\\r\\n    Loewy believes the foreign debt problem, a good crop, plus\\r\\ndifficulties with storage would help motivate selling of the\\r\\nBrazil soybean crop. Brazilian farmers also need cash flow and\\r\\nthey cant afford to store the crops, he said.\\r\\n    The Chicago soybean complex has been nervous for some time\\r\\nabout large South American crops developing under near ideal\\r\\nconditions towards record yields.\\r\\n    We are going to see a very rapid decline, earlier than\\r\\nusual, this year in our (U.S.) exports, Loewy said.\\r\\n    Tommy Eshleman, economist for the American Soybean\\r\\nAssociation (ASA), said this years Brazilian soybean harvest\\r\\ncould total 18 mln tonnes, versus 13.7 mln last year.\\r\\n    Marketings will be very aggressive this summer when prices\\r\\nare usually high relative to the rest of the year due to the\\r\\nvulnerability of the U.S. crop to bad growing weather.\\r\\n    Another incentive to sell might be trade anticipation of a\\r\\nreduction in the U.S. government soybean loan rate, offered to\\r\\nfarmers who give crops as collateral, Eshleman said.\\r\\n    He said there has been some uncertainty this year about the\\r\\nsoybean loan rate, which acts as an effective floor for prices\\r\\nby keeping supplies away from the free market. Farmers can\\r\\nforfeit their beans to the government rather than repay the\\r\\nloan.\\r\\n    Were getting into a period when they (Brazil) are\\r\\nstarting to harvest and starting to export, Eshleman said. But\\r\\nhe added it will be a while before U.S. exports fall to below\\r\\n10 mln bushels a week from around 20 mln bushels currently.\\r\\n    Jose Melicias from the research department of Drexel\\r\\nBurnham Lambert said Brazil would be trying to export as much\\r\\nas it can this year because of its economic situation.\\r\\n    He said the debt situation was a major consideration. The\\r\\nBrazilian government also does not have enough money to pay for\\r\\nstorage, he added.\\r\\n    Asked if a return to an inflationary environment in Brazil\\r\\nwould make farmers inclined to hold onto crops, Melicias said\\r\\nit would not make a big difference.\\r\\n    On other commodity markets, Brazils selling impact may be\\r\\nmuted no matter its need to generate capital.\\r\\n    Brazil is faced with a poor 1986/87 sugar harvest, which\\r\\ncould limit exports to the world market, analysts said. The\\r\\ncountry may have oversold and be unable to honor export\\r\\ncommitments, and this plus higher domestic demand caused by\\r\\nconsumer price subsidies on ethanol and refined sugar, will\\r\\ngive it little room to stretch exports, they said.\\r\\n    Brazils other major crop, cocoa, is in its third year of\\r\\nsurplus. Cocoa consumption is basically flat and last year it\\r\\nfell, so I dont think they can start throwing out cocoa and\\r\\nfind many more markets for it, one analyst said.\\r\\n    If they come out as aggressive sellers, the market would\\r\\ncollapse and they cant afford to do that, she added.\\r\\n Reuter\\r\\n&#3;\\',0\\r\\n\\'IEA SAYS OPEC FEBRUARY CRUDE OUTPUT 16.1 MLN BPD OPEC produced an average 16.1 mln barrels\\r\\nper day (bpd) of crude oil in February, down from 16.5 mln the\\r\\nprevious month and an overall 17.3 mln bpd in fourth quarter\\r\\n1986, the International Energy Agency said.\\r\\n    A few OPEC countries last month exceeded the production\\r\\nquotas set at their last conference in December, but liftings\\r\\nwere reduced from several countries, it said in its latest\\r\\nmonthly oil market report.\\r\\n    These cutbacks were due in part to buyer resistance to\\r\\nfixed prices, introduced from February 1, particularly for\\r\\nfixed volumes over an extended period.\\r\\n    It gave this breakdown for OPEC crude output, in mln bpd\\r\\n                    FOURTH QTR 1986  JANUARY 1987  FEBRUARY\\r\\n1987\\r\\n    SAUDI ARABIA    4.9              3.7           3.8\\r\\n    IRAN            1.6              2.2           1.9\\r\\n    IRAQ            1.6              1.6           1.7\\r\\n    UAE             1.3              1.2           1.2\\r\\n    KUWAIT          1.0              1.0           1.0\\r\\n    NEUTRAL ZONE    0.5              0.4           0.4\\r\\n    QATAR           0.3              0.3           0.2\\r\\n    NIGERIA         1.3              1.2           1.2\\r\\n    LIBYA           1.0              1.0           1.0\\r\\n                    FOURTH QTR 1986  JANUARY 1987  FEBRUARY\\r\\n1987\\r\\n    ALGERIA         0.6              0.6           0.6\\r\\n    GABON           0.1              0.2           0.2\\r\\n    VENEZUELA       1.6              1.6           1.6\\r\\n    ECUADOR         0.2              0.2           0.2\\r\\n    INDONESIA       1.3              1.2           1.2\\r\\n    TOTAL           17.3             16.5          16.1\\r\\n    The IEA said while Saudi production stayed below its quota\\r\\nof 4.133 mln bpd, actual sales might exceed output due to\\r\\nNorbec stock disposals.

We have the\\r\\nimpression it may be difficult to get even two per cent growth\\r\\nthis year.\\r\\n    The big question is whether the governments policy of wage\\r\\nmoderation will be maintained, he added.\\r\\n    The government has set public sector wage rises at aboout\\r\\n1.7 per cent this year, with a three per cent ceiling for rises\\r\\njustified by increased productivity.\\r\\n    But the head of the socialist CFDT union federation, Edmond\\r\\nMaire, meeting with Chirac today, renewed union demands already\\r\\nrejected by the government for indexation clauses to be built\\r\\ninto future pay contracts to safeguard workers against higher\\r\\nprices.\\r\\n    Calling the governments policies unbalanced and unjust, he\\r\\nalso demanded investment incentives to boost employment. He\\r\\nannounced after his meeting that Chirac had told him the\\r\\ngovernment would spend two billion francs on a series of\\r\\nmeasures to boost employment and training\\r\\n    Andre Bergeron, a widely respected leader of the moderate\\r\\nForce Ouvriere labour group, put similar demands to Chirac\\r\\nearlier in the week while the Communist-led CGT, the largest of\\r\\nFrances unions, declared the defence of its members earnings\\r\\nits top priority.\\r\\n    But with unemployment nearing 11 per cent last month, and\\r\\nstill rising, government supporters and some economic analysts\\r\\nsaid they were confident Chirac could resist union pay demands.\\r\\n    Salary indexation was ended by the previous Socialist\\r\\ngovernment and I dont think this administration is going to\\r\\nreverse that, commented Michel Develle, economist at\\r\\nrecently-privatised Banque Paribas.\\r\\n    Damaging transport and electricity strikes over Christmas\\r\\nand the New Year, partly blamed by the government for higher\\r\\ninflation, had undermined the unions power and popularity, he\\r\\nsaid.\\r\\n    Develle said Paribas expected inflation to rise even more\\r\\nthan the governments revised forecast, perhaps to 2.6 or 2.7\\r\\nper cent this year against last years 2.1 per cent.\\r\\n    But that would still be an exceptional achievement\\r\\nconsidering that for the first time since the Second World War\\r\\nall french prices have been freed, he commented.\\r\\n    Finance Ministry officials said that the governments\\r\\nabolition of price and rent controls last year was responsible\\r\\nfor nearly a quarter of a 0.9 per cent surge in January living\\r\\ncosts.\\r\\n    But they claimed it was a once-off phenomenon that should\\r\\nhave no knock-on impact on the rest of the year.\\r\\n    Both Marais and Develle said they agreed with that, so long\\r\\nas the government kept wages under control.\\r\\n    Prices could rise 1.5 per cent in the first three months of\\r\\n1987 and two per cent in the first half year, fractionally more\\r\\nthan forecast this week by the National Statistics Institute,\\r\\nINSEE,  Marais said. But the second half year should be better,\\r\\nhe added.\\r\\n    Ironically, one side effect of higher inflation could be to\\r\\nhelp the government achieve its aim of cutting the state budget\\r\\ndeficit, several analysts said.\\r\\n    So long as public sector wages are held down, higher Value\\r\\nAdded Tax receipts resulting from rising prices should offset a\\r\\nloss in revenues that otherwise would result from slower than\\r\\nexpected growth, they said.\\r\\n   \\r\\n Reuter\\r\\n&#3;\\',0\\r\\n\\'MEXICO SUSPENDS OVERSEAS COFFEE SALES Mexico has temporarily suspended\\r\\noverseas coffee sales due to falling prices triggered by the\\r\\nfailure of the International Coffee Organisation (ICO) meeting\\r\\nto agree a quota system at its latest meeting, the official\\r\\nNotimex news agency said.\\r\\n    Were just waiting a while for prices to improve, an\\r\\nunidentified Mexican trader told the agency.\\r\\n    Mexico has already sold 80 pct of its export coffee\\r\\nproduced in the year to last September, the source said.

This is going to raise some eyebrows\\r\\nat the Fed, McCarthy said.\\r\\n    Stephen Slifer of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc added, We\\r\\nhave some very good-looking monetary aggregate data. Its\\r\\ncoming in a lot weaker than I thought.    \\r\\n    The economists were quick to caution that one months data\\r\\nprove nothing, especially because money growth previously had\\r\\nbeen so rapid. M-1 in the last 52 weeks has grown at a 16.7 pct\\r\\nrate and at a 19.1 pct rate in the past 13 weeks.\\r\\n    Moreover, some of the contraction in M-2 can probably be\\r\\nexplained by a shift of funds from savings vehicles into the\\r\\nbooming stock market and is thus not an indication of a\\r\\nslowdown in the business expansion.\\r\\n    But the data raise the tantalizing possibility for the bond\\r\\nmarkets that the slowdown in money growth is partly a\\r\\nreflection of a weaker economy that needs more Fed stimulus.\\r\\n    McCarthy noted that the slower money growth coincides with\\r\\nsigns that the economy is losing momentum as the quarter\\r\\nprogresses. Some of the economic indicators are not as rosy as\\r\\nthey were a month ago, he noted.\\r\\n    He expects only five to six pct M-1 growth in March and\\r\\nrises in M-2 and M-3 of about four pct.\\r\\n    Slifer sees stronger growth of 10 pct in M-1 and five pct\\r\\nor less for M-2 and M-3, but the rates would still be moderate\\r\\nenough to encourage the Fed to ease policy if gross national\\r\\nproduct for the first quarter proved to be weak. Youd\\r\\ncertainly be more inclined to ease than you would in the past.\\r\\n    There was certainly nothing in the Feds latest balance\\r\\nsheet, however, to suggest a change of policy is already under\\r\\nway, economists said.

This follows a\\r\\n319,000 gain in January, revised down from a previously\\r\\nreported 448,000 increase.\\r\\n    Even if you look at January and February together, this is\\r\\nstill a much stronger report than the consensus expectation in\\r\\nthe market, said Allan Leslie of Discount Corporation.\\r\\n    Economists stressed that gains in hours worked signal much\\r\\nlarger gains in February U.S. production and income than\\r\\npreviously forecast.\\r\\n    The average work week rose 0.2 hours to 35.0 hours from\\r\\n34.8 hours in January. The average manufacturing work week rose\\r\\n0.3 hours to 41.2 hours, the longest factory work week since\\r\\nNovember 1966, the Commerce Department said.\\r\\n    The gains in manufacturing employment point to a very\\r\\nlarge increase in industrial production of between 0.5 and 0.7\\r\\npct, said Joe Carson of Chemical Bank. This compares to a 0.4\\r\\npct  gain in January U.S. industrial production.\\r\\n    Peter Greenbaum of Smith Barney Harris Upham and Co Inc\\r\\nnoted that the average wage rate increased to 8.87 dlrs an hour\\r\\nin February from 8.83 dlrs in January.\\r\\n    Combined with the increase in hours worked, this means\\r\\nwell get a pretty healthy gain in personal income vis-a-vis\\r\\nthe wage and salary disbursement, he said.\\r\\n    Greenbaum said that February U.S. personal income should\\r\\nrise at least 0.5 pct after being flat in January.\\r\\n    He said the February employment gains are consistent with\\r\\nhis firms first quarter U.S. real gross national product\\r\\ngrowth forecast of 3.7 pct.\\r\\n    Economists agreed that the employment data were negative\\r\\nfor the credit markets in that they signal a healthier economy\\r\\nand no easing in the Federal Reserves monetary policy. But\\r\\nmost said that the market need not fear tighter policy either.\\r\\n    This report is another reason for the Fed to not consider\\r\\neasing, said Ray Stone of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc.  \\r\\n  It gives them more room to address the dollar situation, he\\r\\nsaid. If they had to nudge policy tighter, they could do so,\\r\\nbut its most likely theyll sit and wait.\\r\\n    The data have not been uniform, Stone added. Durable\\r\\ngoods were weak in January and now employment is strong.\\r\\n    In January, U.S. durable goods orders dropped 7.5 pct,\\r\\nfollowed by a 4.0 pct drop in U.S. factory goods orders. U.S.\\r\\nretail sales fell 5.8 pct, and the U.S. merchandise trade gap\\r\\nwidened to 14.8 billion dlrs.\\r\\n    Things just arent adding up, said Steve Slifer of Lehman\\r\\nGoverment Securities Inc. Consumer spending, capital spending,\\r\\ngoverment spending, and net exports data show very weak first\\r\\nquarter GNP growth of one pct, he said.\\r\\n    The employment and production data point to a big\\r\\ninventory build-up, but thats what we thought in the fourth\\r\\nquarter and we only got 1.3 pct GNP growth.\\r\\n    Manufacturing employment gained 50,000 after falling 15,000\\r\\nin January. Economists estimated that 30,000 of the gain was\\r\\naccounted for by striking workers in the steel and machinery\\r\\nindustries returning to work.\\r\\n    Even so, some economists said that the manufacturing gains\\r\\nhave resulted from an improving trade outlook.\\r\\n    Jason Benderly of Goldman, Sachs and Co noted that the U.S.\\r\\ntrade picture improved in the fourth quarter as net exports\\r\\ngrew at a 20 pct annual rate while the rate of increase in\\r\\nimports fell to only six pct, and that it continues to improve\\r\\nin the first quarter.\\r\\n    Not only the official statistics for the fourth quarter,\\r\\nbut evidence of a pick up in orders from overseas for paper\\r\\nproducts, chemicals, high-tech goods, and capital goods show\\r\\nthat trade is improving, Benderley said.\\r\\n    The economy is moving between extremes, he said. Some\\r\\nreports are going to look bad and some good, but first quarter\\r\\nGNP is going to grow in the middle at about three pct.\\r\\n    A 287,000 gain in services employment comprised the greater\\r\\npart of Februarys employment gain. Retail services employment\\r\\nrose 129,000 in February, compared to a gain of 117,000 in\\r\\nJanuary, previously reported at 166,000.\\r\\n    Construction employment rose a slim 2,000 in February. But\\r\\nthis follows a robust 113,000 gain in January, revised down\\r\\nfrom a previously reported 142,000 gain.\\r\\n    The U.S. civilian unemployment rate was unchanged in\\r\\nFebruary at 6.7 pct. This means the jobless rate has stayed at\\r\\n6.7 pct for three consecutive months, the lowest reading since\\r\\nMarch 1980, the Commerce Department noted.\\r\\n    The Federal Reserve has to be pleased with this report,\\r\\nCarson said.

International Monetary Fund team there is\\r\\nscope for further cuts in 1988.\\r\\n    The suggestion is contained in the preliminary conclusions\\r\\nof the annual IMF consultations with Belgium on its economic\\r\\npolicy, a copy of which was distributed to journalists at the\\r\\nweekly press conference following meetings of the cabinet.\\r\\n    The IMF team also urges Belgium to adopt a firm interest\\r\\nrate policy, with a particular emphasis on long-term rates.\\r\\n    The teams report to the government praises last years\\r\\nspending cuts, which are due to reduce 1987 government spending\\r\\nby 195 billion francs, and says 1986 saw the Belgian economy\\r\\nperform better, on a broader basis, than at any time so far in\\r\\nthe 1980s.\\r\\n    However, it adds that with lower inflation, stabilisation\\r\\nof the debt to gross national product ratio requires a much\\r\\nlower budget deficit than the seven pct of GNP target the\\r\\ngovernment has set itself for 1989.\\r\\n    The governments net financing requirement was 11.0 pct of\\r\\nGNP in 1986.\\r\\n    The report says The most that can be afforded over the next\\r\\nfew years is a zero growth of real non-interest expenditure of\\r\\ngeneral Government.\\r\\n    It says there is a need for a revision of the Belgian tax\\r\\nsystem to iron out distortions and meet hopes of a reduced tax\\r\\nburden but substantial progress is needed in stabilising the\\r\\ndebt to GNP ratio before this is possible.\\r\\n    Because of the difficulty of sustaining zero expenditure\\r\\ngrowth and of likely growing impatience (for) tax reductions,\\r\\nwe feel that your position would be stronger if you could\\r\\ndecide on rather sharp expenditure reductions in 1988, the\\r\\nreport adds.\\r\\n    The IMF urges a strong interest rate policy to signal the\\r\\ngovernments determination to keep its currency strong and to\\r\\ncurb inflation.\\r\\n    It says firmer long-term rates would slow private net\\r\\nlong-term capital outflows, which increased strongly in 1986.\\r\\n    It also urges net repayments of foreign currency debt and\\r\\nan overhaul of domestic capital markets to facilitate

The question is\\r\\ntherefore how large a rise he is ready to see before acting.\\r\\n    Paul Temperton, chief economist at Merrill Lynch Europe\\r\\nLtd, estimated that the government wanted to see the\\r\\ntrade-weighted index about 72-73 pct.

contribution to Australian economic growth in fiscal\\r\\n1986/87, ending June 30, while net exports will account for all\\r\\nof the overall increase, Treasurer Paul Keating said here.\\r\\n    However, he did not say in his speech to the Economic\\r\\nPlanning Advisory Council (EPAC) if the forecast 2.25 pct rise\\r\\nin gross domestic product (gdp) had been revised.\\r\\n    But Keating said domestic demand could fall slightly this\\r\\nfinancial year and net export growth will provide the total\\r\\nsource of gdp growth.\\r\\n    The August budget had forecast domestic demand would\\r\\ncontribute 0.75 percentage points to non-farm gdp growth of 2.5\\r\\npct while net exports would account for 1.75 points.\\r\\n    Keating said the overall impact of the changed economic\\r\\nparameters is welcome as it appears to have contributed to a\\r\\nslightly more rapid correction in the current account deficit\\r\\nthan first anticipated.\\r\\n    The government initially forecast a current account deficit\\r\\nfor 1986/87 of 14.75 billion -- our present expectation is that\\r\\nthe result will be somewhat lower, around 14 billion, he said.\\r\\n    Partial indicators released since the last meeting of EPAC\\r\\nin December indicate that the 1986/87 budget strategy is\\r\\nbroadly on track, Keating said.\\r\\n    They indicate that domestic demand has been a little more\\r\\nsluggish than was expected at budget time, he said.\\r\\n    On the other hand, net exports seem to be expanding by more\\r\\nthan expected at budget time, and this is underpinning growth\\r\\nin domestic production and employment.\\r\\n    Keating said it now seems likely that the 1986/87 inflation\\r\\nrate will exceed the budget forecast of eight pct.\\r\\n    Nevertheless, there is likely to be a marked slowing in\\r\\ninflation over coming quarters as depreciation and budgetary\\r\\neffects wane, he said.\\r\\n    Keating said the government expects economic growth to pick\\r\\nup moderately in 1987/88 due to a further significant rise in\\r\\nnet exports and a very moderate but positive contribution from\\r\\nprivate domestic demand.\\r\\n    He said domestic demand growth will be due to a\\r\\nstrengthening in real household disposable income.\\r\\n    The moderate rise in economic growth next financial year\\r\\nshould be sufficient to sustain employment growth at a level\\r\\nbroadly equivalent to that of the current fiscal year.\\r\\n    The current account deficit will continue to show\\r\\nimprovement in 1987/88, Keating said.\\r\\n    As the impact of the exchange rate depreciations of recent\\r\\nyears recede further, and given continued effective wage\\r\\nrestraint, inflation should moderate markedly in 1987/88,

2.1\\r\\npct to 242 mln guilders, he added.\\r\\n    Lower global interest rates in 1986 had nipped earnings\\r\\nmargins via traditional lending activities, he said.\\r\\n    Hazelhoff said ABN was

That could send prices\\r\\n50 cts to a dollar higher, he added.\\r\\n    The U.S. benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate rose to\\r\\n18.15 dlrs a barrel today, a rise of 1.50 dlrs this week.\\r\\n    The rally in oil prices this week came after prices fell in\\r\\nFebruary more than two dlrs from its high of 18.25 dlrs a\\r\\nbarrel.\\r\\n    Oil traders were pulling prices down on the assumption that\\r\\noil stocks were building and OPEC was producing well above its\\r\\n15.8 mln bpd quota, but now both of those assumptions have come\\r\\nunder question, McKinley said.\\r\\n    Yesterday the International Energy Agency in its monthly\\r\\nreport said that oil stocks in the OECD area, or in\\r\\nindustrialized nations, were drawn down by 1.3 mln bpd during\\r\\nthe first quarter of this year.\\r\\n    IEA estimates that the draw in oil stocks during the first\\r\\nquarter of this year will come largely from oil companies whose\\r\\ninventory levels by April one will be an estimated 326 mln\\r\\ntonnes, or about 74 days consumption.\\r\\n    Industry analysts also said the estimate of a 3.5 mln bpd\\r\\ndraw in stocks made by Shell Chairman Peter Holmes yesterday\\r\\nfed speculation that other major companies were destocking.\\r\\n    Traders said the destocking has come about as a result of a\\r\\nso-called buyers strike, which kept refiners from buying\\r\\nofficially priced OPEC oil in an effort to get the organization\\r\\nto offer discounts to the official price.\\r\\n    This struggle between the companies and OPEC is the\\r\\nultimate game of chicken but it will be resolved relatively\\r\\nsoon. I would imagine by about the middle of the month (March),\\r\\nthe general trading manager of an international oil company\\r\\ntold Reuters in a telephone interview.\\r\\n    For its part OPEC has moved to win this game by cutting\\r\\nexcess supplies from the market by a reduction of its own\\r\\noutput, traders said. A Reuter survey estimates OPEC output to\\r\\nbe 14.7 mln bpd this week.\\r\\n    Also, an earthquake in Ecuador yesterday led it to suspend\\r\\noil exports indefintiely and force majeure its shipments.\\r\\n    This will reduce short-haul availabilities by about 250,000\\r\\nbpd almost immediately and the longer the suspension continues,\\r\\nthe larger the draw in stocks will be for companies expecting\\r\\nit to be there, McKinley said.\\r\\n    International oil traders said that other short-haul\\r\\ncrudes, such as North Sea Brent, were also scarce because Asian\\r\\nrefiners bought the oil after absorbing a lot of the readily\\r\\navailable Mideast crudes earlier this week.\\r\\n    If this pattern continues then oil companies will bid up\\r\\nthe price of oil as they purchase for their refineries, trading\\r\\nmanagers at several companies told Reuters.\\r\\n    But there were skeptics who said they wondered how long\\r\\nOPEC can retain its unity if buyer resistance continues.\\r\\n    Stephen Hanke, chief economist at Friedburg Commodity\\r\\nManagement, said OPEC production was lower because of the\\r\\nSaudi cut (to 3.1 mln bpd) and this could spell trouble if it\\r\\ngives other members an incentive to exceed their quotas.\\r\\n     He added, The Saudis will be picking up the tab for other\\r\\nmembers who produce over their quota, and the drain on the\\r\\nSaudis will continue, forcing them to cut output maybe as low\\r\\nas 2.5 mln bpd to support the 18 dlrs average price, he added.\\r\\n    There are also signs of some OPEC crudes being sold in the\\r\\nspot market at below OPEC official prices, traders said.\\r\\n    Oil traders said Nigerian Brass River sold for delivery\\r\\ninto the U.S. Gulf at a price related to North Sea brent, which\\r\\ntraded this week at 17.60 dlrs, far below the official price of\\r\\n18.92 dlrs for the similar quality Bonny Light.\\r\\n    Iranian oil is also surfacing in the U.S. Gulf and the Far\\r\\nEast at reported discounts to its 17.50 dlrs official price.\\r\\n    There is a lot of oil priced on government-to-government\\r\\ndeals, which are below official prices and this is probably\\r\\nbeing resold, one international trader said.\\r\\n Reuter\\r\\n&#3;\\',0\\r\\n\\'MGE PLANNING APRIL 6 START UP OF HFCS CONTRACT The Minneapolis Grain Exchange (MGE)\\r\\nwill start trading futures contracts in high fructose corn\\r\\nsyrup on April 6 if the Commodity Futures Trading Commission\\r\\n(CFTC) approves the contract as expected next week.\\r\\n    Pat Henderson, spokesperson for the MGE, said the exchange\\r\\nexpects contract approval at CFTCs Tuesday meeting. It has\\r\\nbeen under review since the exchange submitted the proposal in\\r\\nDecember, 1985.\\r\\n    The proposed contract is based on 48,000 pound lots of\\r\\n55-pct high fructose corn syrup, the equivalent of one tank\\r\\ntruck of the sweetening agent derived from corn in the wet\\r\\nmilling process. The syrup, commonly called HFCS-55, is most\\r\\ncommonly used as a sweetener in soft drinks and other\\r\\nbeverages.\\r\\n    Delivery would be by shipping certificate from production\\r\\nfacilities designated by the exchange. The contract, designated\\r\\nby the symbol HF, would trade from 0900 to 1315 CST. Months\\r\\ntraded would correspond with the Chicago corn futures months of\\r\\nMarch, May, July, September and December.\\r\\n    Contract price will be quoted per hundred weight, with a\\r\\nminimum price fluctuation of one cent and maximum fluctuation\\r\\nof one dlr per CWT.\\r\\n    We hope the producers and users of fructose will be\\r\\nactively involved, those producers being the large processors,\\r\\nthe corn wet millers, and the users being the beverage\\r\\nbottlers, Henderson said.

This is the lowest rate of growth since the\\r\\nmid-1960s, the report notes.\\r\\n    Indonesia, the largest country in South-East Asia with a\\r\\npopulation of 168 million, is facing general elections in\\r\\nApril.\\r\\n    But the report hold out little hope for swift improvement\\r\\nin the economic outlook. For 1987 early indications point to a\\r\\nslightly positive growth rate not exceeding one pct. Economic\\r\\nactivity continues to suffer due to the sharp fall in export\\r\\nearnings from the petroleum industry.\\r\\n    Growth in the non-oil sector is low because of weak\\r\\ndomestic demand coupled with excessive plant capacity, real\\r\\ndeclines in construction and trade, and a reduced level of\\r\\ngrowth in agriculture, the report states.\\r\\n    Bankers say continuation of present economic reforms is\\r\\ncrucial for the government to get the international lending its\\r\\nneeds.\\r\\n    A new World Bank loan of 300 mln dlrs last month in balance\\r\\nof payments support was given partly to help the government\\r\\nmaintain the momentum of reform, the Bank said.\\r\\n REUTER\\r\\n&#3;\\',0\\r\\n\\'U.S. FEEDGRAINS GROUP ATTACKS CANADA CORN RULING The U.S. Feedgrains Council is\\r\\nsurprised and disappointed by the Canadian Import Tribunals\\r\\ndecision that imports of corn from the U.S. are materially\\r\\ninjuring Canadian corn producers, a council spokesman said.\\r\\n    At a time when the world is attempting to liberalize trade\\r\\nin the new rounnd of multilateral negotiations, it is\\r\\nincomprehensible that a country that stands to gain so much\\r\\nfrom the reduction in agricultural trade barriers would\\r\\nthreaten that process by caving in to pressures for\\r\\nprotectionism, council president Darwin E.

The\\r\\namount of corn we export to Canada is insignificant.\\r\\n    The unexpected ruling appeared to be based on the agrument\\r\\nthat Canada bases its corn prices on U.S. futures prices and\\r\\nthat American farm policy has driven down these prices, thus\\r\\ncausing lower prices to Canadian farmers and larger government\\r\\npayments through its farm stabilization program, Hall said.\\r\\n    Hall said this is a new definition for injury, but that\\r\\nother nations might also now apply this same argument to attack\\r\\nU.S. farm programs.\\r\\n    The French corn growers could now charge that U.S. farm\\r\\nprograms create an unfair subsidy for corn gluten feed, Hall\\r\\nsaid.

Only Kuwait has an official stock\\r\\nexchange, while other Gulf nations have yet to establish\\r\\nexchanges.\\r\\n    But with dwindling financial surpluses in the Gulf,\\r\\ngovernments are actively pursuing ways to develop capital\\r\\nmarkets and set up domestic stock exchanges, Azzam said.\\r\\n    He said recession stemming from sliding oil prices had\\r\\nclearly had a negative impact on the development of capital\\r\\nmarkets in the region.\\r\\n    In addition, family firms are reluctant to go public,\\r\\nfinancial awareness among investors is still lacking and\\r\\ninvestment analysis and corporate reporting standards lack\\r\\ndepth. A sharp fall in share prices in the early 1980s prompted\\r\\ninvestors to hold on to shares hoping for an eventual recovery.\\r\\n    Azzam said the absence of proper commercial law in some\\r\\nGulf countries and authorities apparent reluctance to adopt\\r\\nfinancial innovations had also hampered capital markets.\\r\\n    He called for clearly defined laws governing incorporation\\r\\nof joint stock companies and the flotation of debt instruments.\\r\\n    Azzam said capital market instruments should be made\\r\\navailable to all citizens and institutions of Gulf Cooperation\\r\\nCouncil (GCC) states -- Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, Saudi\\r\\nArabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Some moves had been\\r\\ntaken in this direction, with Bahrain allowing GCC nationals to\\r\\nown up to 25 pct of locally incorporated companies.\\r\\n    Azzam said Gulf money markets had received greater depth\\r\\nfrom the introduction of treasury bill offerings in Bahrain and\\r\\nthe expansion of securities repurchase regulations in Saudi\\r\\nArabia.\\r\\n    But he added there is no bond market to speak of in Saudi\\r\\nArabia, Qatar, Oman or the UAE, with the last Saudi riyal\\r\\ndenominated bond issued in 1978.\\r\\n    While Bahrain plans an official stock exchange and trading\\r\\nin Saudi Arabia has picked up, establishment of formal\\r\\nexchanges in Qatar, Oman and the UAE does not appear imminent,\\r\\nAzzam said.\\r\\n REUTER\\r\\n&#3;\\',0\\r\\n\\'POSITIVE OUTLOOK TEMPERED IN U.S. DEBT FUTURES Higher oil prices and stronger than\\r\\nexpected U.S. employment growth led to sharp losses in U.S.\\r\\ninterest rate futures and diminished what had been a positive\\r\\nchart outlook, financial analysts said.\\r\\n    The increase of 319,000 in non-farm payroll employment\\r\\nduring February was above market expectations for a rise of\\r\\n170,000 to 200,000 jobs and sparked selling in Treasury bond\\r\\nfutures that drove the June contract through key technical\\r\\nsupport at 101-2/32 at the opening Friday, they noted.\\r\\n    I dont like that fact that we had a close below 101,\\r\\nsaid Prudential Bache analyst Fred Leiner.

Analysts said the\\r\\nspeculation also focused on American Express selling 20 pct of\\r\\nthe profitable brokerage firm to the public.\\r\\n    There was some speculation that American Express had also\\r\\nconsidered a total spinoff of Shearson, but the plan was\\r\\nconsidered highly unlikely, analysts said.\\r\\n     American Express said in the statement on Sunday that it\\r\\nwill not comment on rumors and speculation and a spokesman\\r\\nwould not go beyond the statement. The company also remained\\r\\nsilent last Thursday and Friday, as rumors drove American\\r\\nExpress stock up a total of 5-1/2 dlrs in two days to bring it\\r\\nto a Friday close at 74.\\r\\n     It said it issued the statement on Sunday because a\\r\\nsimilar statement was being circulated to employees.\\r\\n    Analysts have been divided on whether it makes sense for\\r\\nAmerican Express to give up a stake in the wholly-owned\\r\\nbrokerage, which improved its after-tax earnings by about 50\\r\\npct in the last year.\\r\\n    Some analysts said American Express may consider spinning\\r\\noff part of Shearson because it is concerned that its stock\\r\\nprice does not fully reflect the value of the brokerage firm.\\r\\n     Shearson contributed 316 mln dlrs of American Express\\r\\n1.25 billion dlr net in 1986.\\r\\n    American Express ambitious plans for international growth\\r\\nmay be also enhanced by the added cash that spinning out part\\r\\nof Shearson would bring. Analysts speculated that all of\\r\\nShearson would have a market value of about 3.5 billion dlrs.\\r\\n    To some however, the need for added capital is puzzling.\\r\\n(American) Express is in a position where they can raise\\r\\ncapital if they need to, said Larry Eckenfelder of\\r\\nPrudential-Bache Securities.\\r\\n    Analysts said rumors were fed by the reorganization of\\r\\nShearson management Wednesday. Chief operating officer Jeffrey\\r\\nLane got the added, previously vacant, post of president.\\r\\n     The reorganization also created four new positions for\\r\\nchairmen of Shearsons operating divisions, a move analysts\\r\\nspeculated would allow Shearson to be a stand alone company.\\r\\n     Analysts, contacted on Sunday said the statement does\\r\\nlittle to clarify last weeks market speculation. It does\\r\\nconfirm, however, that the financial services firm, which\\r\\nunsuccessfully attempted to expand Shearson with a major\\r\\nacquisition last year, is looking beyond its own walls for\\r\\ngrowth and positioning in the global market competition.\\r\\n    Late last year, Shearsons takeover offer to the E.F.\\r\\nHutton Group Inc was rejected by Hutton, and analysts said\\r\\nthere had been speculation that Shearson also was rebuffed when\\r\\nit approached another major Wall Street brokerage.        \\r\\n Reuter\\r\\n&#3;\\',0\\r\\n\\'ROPAK &lt;ROPK> HAS 34 PCT OF BUCKHORN &lt;BKN> Ropak Corp said it received\\r\\nand accepted about 456,968 common shares and 527,035 Series A\\r\\nconvertible preferred shares of Buckhorn Inc at four dlrs and\\r\\n5.75 dlrs each respectively in response to its tender offer\\r\\nthat expired Friday, and it now owns 34.4 pct of Buckhorn\\r\\nvoting power.\\r\\n    The company had owned 63,000 common and 25,100 preferred\\r\\nshares before starting the hostile tender.

steelmakers\\r\\npresented the Executive Commission with a controversial plan\\r\\nfor the future of the industry which diplomats say it may be\\r\\nforced reluctantly to accept.\\r\\n    Under the plan steel output would remain subject to\\r\\nrestrictive quotas and imports would be firmly controlled for\\r\\nyears to come while steel firms undertook a massive\\r\\nslimming-down operation to adjust capacity to lower demand.\\r\\n    Industry Commissioner Karl-Heinz Narjes has proposed the\\r\\nending of the quota system by December 1988.\\r\\n    He has proposed a return to the free market, which under EC\\r\\nlaw is supposed to exist except in times of manifest crisis.\\r\\n    But diplomats said some ministers who meet to discuss this\\r\\nidea on March 19 will argue that steel firms are in crisis in\\r\\ntheir countries, with orders falling as customers switch to\\r\\nalternative products and accounts firmly in the red.\\r\\n    Ministers from the ECs major steel producing countries are\\r\\nlikely to shy away from Narjes proposals and could back the\\r\\nindustrys own plan instead, in the hope of minimising the\\r\\npolitical impact of plant closures, they said.\\r\\n    Industry sources said the plan presented to Narjes by the\\r\\nEC steelmakers lobby group Eurofer would retain the quota\\r\\nproduction system at least until the end of 1990.\\r\\n    Eurofer said in a statement consultants working for it\\r\\nidentified scope for closing plants on a voluntary basis to\\r\\nreduce capacity by 15.26 mln tonnes a year.\\r\\n    Cuts were still insufficient in one

initially hailed at home and abroad as the saviour of the\\r\\neconomy, is limping towards its first anniversary amid soaring\\r\\nprices, widespread shortages and a foreign payments crisis.\\r\\n    Announced last February 28 the plan froze prices, fixed the\\r\\nvalue of the new Cruzado currency and ended widespread\\r\\nindexation of the economy in a bid to halt the countrys 250\\r\\npct inflation rate.\\r\\n    But within a year the plan has all but collapsed.\\r\\n    The situation now is worse than it was. Although there was\\r\\ninflation, at least the economy worked, a leading bank\\r\\neconomist said.\\r\\n    The crumbling of the plan has been accompanied by a\\r\\ndramatic reversal in the foreign trade account. In 1984 and\\r\\n1985 Brazils annual trade surpluses had been sufficient to\\r\\ncover the 12 billion dlrs needed to service its 109 billion dlr\\r\\nforeign debt.\\r\\n    For the first nine months of 1986 all seemed to be on\\r\\ntarget for a repeat, with monthly surpluses averaging one\\r\\nbillion dlrs. But as exports were diverted and imports\\r\\nincreased to avoid further domestic shortages the trade surplus\\r\\nplunged to 211 mln dlrs in October and since then has averaged\\r\\nunder 150 mln.\\r\\n Reuter\\r\\n&#3;\\',0\\r\\n\\'&lt;FRANKLIN UTILITIES FUND> SETS PAYOUT Qtly div 14 cts vs 14 cts prior\\r\\n    Pay March 13\\r\\n    Record March Two\\r\\n Reuter\\r\\n&#3;\\',0\\r\\n\\'GELCO CORP &lt;GEL> 2ND QTR JAN 31 NET Shr 67 cts vs 23 cts\\r\\n    Net 5,220,000 vs 3,143,000\\r\\n    Revs 236.1 mln vs 256.2 mln\\r\\n    Avg shrs 7.8 mln vs 13.7 mln\\r\\n    Six Mths\\r\\n    Shr 85 cts vs 59 cs\\r\\n    Net 8,919,000 vs 8,158,000\\r\\n    Revs 483.8 mln vs 515.5 mln\\r\\n    Avg shrs 10.4 mln vs 13.7 mln\\r\\n    NOTE: Fiscal 1987 second quarter and first half earnings\\r\\ninclude a gain of 3.4 mln dlrs and exclude preferred dividend\\r\\nrequirements of five mln dlrs in the quarter and 5.6 mln dlrs\\r\\nin the first half.\\r\\n    Fiscal 1986 net reduced by currency losses equal to six cts\\r\\na share in the second quarter and equal to nine cts in the six\\r\\nmonths.\\r\\n   \\r\\n Reuter\\r\\n&#3;\\',0\\r\\n\\'INTERNCHANGE FINANCIAL SERVICES &lt;ISBJ> PAYOUT UP Qtly div 10 cts vs 8-1/3 cts prior\\r\\n    Pay April 21\\r\\n    Record March 20\\r\\n    NOTE: Interchange Financial Services Corp.\\r\\n Reuter\\r\\n&#3;\\',0\\r\\n\\'KAPOK CORP &lt;KPK> IN TECHNICAL DEFAULT Kapok Corp said it is in\\r\\ntechical default of its loans from Southeast Banking Corp &lt;STB>\\r\\nand Murray Steinfeld but is negotiating with the lenders.\\r\\n    It said neither has declared the loans due.\\r\\n    The company said it has agreed to sell the Peter Pan\\r\\nRestaurant in Urbana, Md., for 1,100,000 dlrs, or one mln dlrs\\r\\nafter the payment of expenses.\\r\\n Reuter\\r\\n&#3;\\',0\\r\\n\\'NEWPORT CORP &lt;NESP> 2ND QTR JAN 31 NET Shr 11 cts vs 13 cts\\r\\n    Net 1,037,690 vs 1,270,460\\r\\n    Sales 10.1 mln vs 9,215,836\\r\\n    Six Mths\\r\\n    Shr 25 cts vs 31 cts\\r\\n    Net 2,319,376 vs 2,930,507\\r\\n    Sales 21.2 mln vs 18.9 mln\\r\\n Reuter\\r\\n&#3;\\',0\\r\\n\\'KAPOK CORP &lt;KPK> 1ST QTR DEC 31 LOSS Shr loss 14 cts vs loss 21 cts\\r\\n    Net loss 353,000 vs loss 541,000\\r\\n    Revs 2,668,000 vs 2,525,000\\r\\n    Avg shrs 2,452,3000 vs 2,552,300\\r\\n Reuter\\r\\n&#3;\\',0\\r\\n\\'PREFERRED HEALTHCARE LTD &lt;PHCC> 4TH QTR NET Shr six cts vs four cts\\r\\n    Net 383,189 vs 241,857\\r\\n    Revs 1,506,756 vs 793,459\\r\\n    12 mths\\r\\n    Shr 24 cts vs 15 cts\\r\\n    Net 1,520,797 vs 929,017\\r\\n    Revs 5,268,486 vs 2,617,995\\r\\n Reuter\\r\\n&#3;\\',0\\r\\n\\'TRANZONIC COS &lt;TNZ> SETS QUARTERLY Qtly div 11 cts vs 11 cts prior\\r\\n    Pay April 17\\r\\n    Record March 20\\r\\n Reuter\\r\\n&#3;\\',0\\r\\n\\'CRONUS INDUSTRIES INC &lt;CRNS> 4TH QTR LOSS Oper Shr loss 40 cts vs loss 10 cts\\r\\n    Oper net loss 2,136,000 vs loss 467,000\\r\\n    Revs 21.9 mln vs 12.9 mln\\r\\n    12 mths\\r\\n    Oper shr loss 63 cts vs loss 30 cts\\r\\n    Oper net loss 3,499,000 vs loss 1,756,000\\r\\n    Revs 82.0 mln vs 54.5 mln\\r\\n    NOTE: Excludes income from discontinued operations of\\r\\n1,478,000 vs 952,000 for qtr, and 31.2 mln vs 6,500,000 for\\r\\nyear.\\r\\n    Excludes extraordinary charge of 2,503,000 for current qtr,\\r\\nand 4,744,000 for year.\\r\\n Reuter\\r\\n&#3;\\',0\\r\\n\\'MERCURY ENTERTAINMENT CORP &lt;MCRY> YEAR NOV 30 Shr loss four cts vs loss one ct\\r\\n    Net loss 413,021 vs loss 163,932\\r\\n    Revs 600,971 vs 665,800\\r\\n Reuter\\r\\n&#3;\\',0\\r\\n\\'N.Z.

A source\\r\\nclose to the management side insisted that timing was on his\\r\\nside. He said if outside directors approve the management\\r\\nproposal, a merger plan could be put to a vote of shareholders\\r\\nwith proxy material going out late this week. It would take 20\\r\\ndays from the day we mail, said the source.\\r\\n    The source predicted National Amusements, controlled by\\r\\ninvestor Sumner Redstone, would need half a year to complete\\r\\na tender offer because of the regulatory approvals that must\\r\\naccompany any change in control of Viacoms broadcast licenses\\r\\nand cable television franchises.\\r\\n    Redstone was not available for comment.\\r\\n    Some of Wall Streets arbitrage players said it was a rare\\r\\nsituation that could only be enjoyed - a true bidding war. One\\r\\nsaid Redstone could begin a tender offer whenever he wanted and\\r\\nif enough people were convinced his proposal was superior to\\r\\nthe Viacom management plan, he would have a chance to win.\\r\\n    The independent directors of Viacom were called into a\\r\\nmeeting today. Word on a decision was expected early tomorrow.\\r\\n    Viacom shares climbed 2-1/2 to 50-3/8 by midafternoon. One\\r\\nmajor Wall Street firm issued a sell recommendation. We think\\r\\nwere at the end now, in terms of bidding, said the firms\\r\\narbitrageur, who spoke on condition he not be identified.\\r\\n    Both Redstones proposal and the management proposal would\\r\\ncreate a restructured company heavily leveraged with debt. The\\r\\nmanagement plan would result in a balance sheet with about 2.5\\r\\nbillion dlrs in debt and nearly 500 mln dlrs in preferred\\r\\nstock, convertible into 45 pct of the common stock.\\r\\n    Redstones newest proposal offers holders 42 dlrs in cash,\\r\\na fraction of a share of exchangeable preferred stock with a\\r\\nvalue of 7.50 dlrs, and one-fifth of a share of common stock\\r\\nstock of Arsenal Holdings, representing 20 pct of the equity\\r\\ninterest in the restructured Viacom. One arbitrageur calculated\\r\\nthe equity in the Redstone plan was worth 2.50 dlrs making the\\r\\ntotal package worth 52 dlrs per share.\\r\\n    Management offered 38.50 dlrs in cash, exchangeable\\r\\npreferred stock worth 8.50 dlrs and a fractional share of\\r\\nconvertible preferred. The arbitrageur said the equity portion\\r\\nwas worth about 4.00 dlrs for a total of 51 dlrs.\\r\\n    Redstones newest plan raised the amount of interest he\\r\\nwould pay on the cash portion of his offer for every day beyond\\r\\nApril 30 that a merger with Arsenal is not consummated. The\\r\\nplan calls for intest to be paid at an annual rate of nine pct\\r\\nduring May and 12 pct thereafter. Previously Redstone offered\\r\\neight pct interest.\\r\\n    Other arbitrageurs said both Redstone and the management\\r\\ngroup, led by president and chief executive Terrence Elkes,\\r\\nwere offering high prices. Redstone really wants to own the\\r\\ncompany, one said. Another said management seemed to have the\\r\\nedge on the timing issue.\\r\\n    Redstones company owns 19.6 pct ov Viacoms 35 mln shares.\\r\\n    A Wall Street analyst said it was hard to determine what\\r\\nthe equity in the newly leveraged company would be worth. He\\r\\nnoted as an example that new stock in FMC Corp &lt;FMC>, which\\r\\nadopted a highly leveraged structure last year, inititally\\r\\ntraded at 12.50 dlrs per share, dipped to nine dlrs, and is now\\r\\njust over 30 dlrs.\\r\\n    Last week, Viacom reported fourth quarter earnings fell two\\r\\ntwo cts per share from 23 cts.

However, the Bass family has not indicated support\\r\\none way or the other for his offer, he said.\\r\\n    Pesch, in an interview with Reuters, said based on the\\r\\nconversations he held with shareholders, he could not guage\\r\\nwhether he had majority support.

The Bass family would not comment on American\\r\\nMedical or Pesch.\\r\\n    Pesch, who led the leveraged buyout of Republic Health Corp\\r\\nlast year, continues to face a credibilty problem on Wall\\r\\nStreet because of the long time it took to finish the Republic\\r\\nacquisition.\\r\\n    Republic also has substantial debt, and has left wall\\r\\nstreet questioning whether financing can be completed for the\\r\\nmuch larger American Medical takeover proposal.\\r\\n    Peschs first offer for American Medical was made without\\r\\nan investment banking firm, another cause for concern to Wall\\r\\nStreet. However, Pesch entered his second offer with\\r\\nrepresentation from Donaldson, Lufkin, and Jenrette Securities\\r\\nand Security Pacific Merchant Banking Group.\\r\\n    I dont have any doubt that the current transaction can be\\r\\nworked out and completed, provided we get to the point where\\r\\nAmi management will sit down and talk in a friendly\\r\\nenvironment, Pesch said.\\r\\n    Pesch would not elaborate on what type of financing\\r\\narrangements are being made. He did say if he succeeds in\\r\\nacquiring American Medical he plans to keep much of American\\r\\nMedical management in place.\\r\\n    He said he plans to combine the company with Republic to\\r\\nform an efficient network of hospitals.\\r\\n    Analysts said they do not believe a much higher offer could\\r\\nbe made for American Medical.\\r\\n    Byron Nimocks of E.F.

failing to produce the\\r\\ngoods its markets need and its loss of competitiveness has left\\r\\nthe government little room for manoeuvre to reflate the\\r\\neconomy, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and\\r\\nDevelopment said.\\r\\n    With gross domestic product likely to grow only 2.1 pct\\r\\nthis year, the same rate as last year, unemployment could climb\\r\\nto 11.5 pct of the workforce by mid-1988, from its present 10.9\\r\\npct, it said in an annual review of the French economy.\\r\\n    The report said the French economy was increasingly\\r\\nill-adapted to demand selling goods at uncompetitive relative\\r\\nprices on both domestic and export markets.\\r\\n    Frances poor export performance reflects a geographical\\r\\nbias in favour of markets less dynamic than the average...\\r\\nAnd...A substantial loss of market share...In the past 18\\r\\nmonths, it said.\\r\\n    Pointing to a likely widening of the French trade deficit\\r\\nto around 2.9 billion dlrs this year from 2.4 billion in 1986,\\r\\nit warned that a further depreciation of the dollar against the\\r\\nfranc could lead to a (renewed) loss of competitiveness\\r\\nrelative not only to the United States but also to the newly\\r\\nindustrialised countries.\\r\\n    This could result in further major losses of market share,\\r\\nparticularly in the non-OECD area, which accounts for almost a\\r\\nquarter of French exports, it said.\\r\\n    Until the competitive ability of industry improved, the\\r\\nauthorities would have little scope for macroeconomic\\r\\nmanoeuvre, even if the unemployment situation or the need to\\r\\nencourage a pickup in investment could require demand to grow\\r\\nmore briskly, it added.\\r\\n    But rising unemployment could help to hold down wage\\r\\ndemands, contributing to a slowdown in inflation to around a\\r\\ntwo pct annual rate this year and early next, the OECD said.\\r\\n    Written mainly in December last year, the report took no\\r\\naccount of a rise in oil prices early in 1987, and a 0.9 pct\\r\\nsurge in January consumer prices, caused partly by the\\r\\ngovernments deregulation of service sector tariffs.\\r\\n    We took a bet that the freeing of prices would not provoke\\r\\nrunaway rises, and it is not absolutely certain that bet has\\r\\nbeen lost, one OECD official commented.\\r\\n    OECD officials said the January data and a rise in oil\\r\\nprices above the 15 dlrs a barrel average assumed in the\\r\\nreport, indicated an upward revision in the inflation forecast\\r\\nto around 2.5 or three pct.\\r\\n    The government last week revised its forecast up to between\\r\\n2.4 and 2.5 pct from two pct, against last years 2.1 pct.\\r\\n    But the OECD backed the governments view that the\\r\\nunderlying trend for inflation remained downwards this year,\\r\\nwith a slowdown in domestic costs taking over from last years\\r\\nfall in oil and commodity prices as the chief cause of\\r\\ndisinflation.\\r\\n    With French unit productivity costs now among the lowest in\\r\\nthe OECD area, the inflation differential between France and\\r\\nits main trading rival, West Germany, could fall to just one\\r\\npct this year, it said.\\r\\n    On the other hand, the report noted, consumer prices for\\r\\nindustrial goods and private services have been rising steeply\\r\\nas companies built up their profits.\\r\\n    For the disinflationary process to continue , and price\\r\\ncompetitiveness to become lastingly compatible with exchange\\r\\nrate stability, it is

The improved\\r\\noutlook results from AMR Corps &lt;AMR> decision to order 40 new\\r\\nplanes powered by CF6-80C2 GE engines.\\r\\n    Creative financial footwork helped GE get the order, said\\r\\nNicholas Heymann, analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.\\r\\n    AMR declined to go into detail on financing arrangements\\r\\nfor its order of 15 Boeing Co &lt;BA> and 25 &lt;Airbus Industrie>\\r\\ntwinjet long distance aircraft.\\r\\n    But AMR said it was using rent-a-plane leases that allow\\r\\nit to operate the aircraft without adding to its debt\\r\\nstructure. AMR also has the right to decline delivery of the\\r\\nplanes or return them on short notice. The arrangement protects\\r\\nAMR in the case of an unexpected development such as a severe\\r\\ndownturn in the economy.\\r\\n    From GEs point of view the package looks like a good deal\\r\\nfor several reasons, Heymann said.\\r\\n    GE will be able to record revenue as a sale at the time of\\r\\ndelivery, Heymann noted.\\r\\n    And if for some reason AMR decides not to take the planes\\r\\nGEs financial arm, General Electric Financial Services Inc,\\r\\nwould have little trouble rounding up another airline that\\r\\nwanted the fuel efficient planes. On the whole, the deal\\r\\nappears to pose little risk for GE, Heymann said.\\r\\n    GEs stock declined 1/4 to 103-1/2 on 625,000 shares by\\r\\nmidafternoon. H.P. Smith, analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham\\r\\nand Co said for a 40 billion dlr (revenue) company no one\\r\\norder will have much of an effect on the stock.\\r\\n    Russell Leavitt, analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc, said the\\r\\norder will help to maintain a good level of production and\\r\\nprofitability in the aircraft engine business for GE.\\r\\n    Heymann sees operating profits from GEs jet engine\\r\\nbusiness rising from 870 mln dlrs last year to 1.3 billion dlrs\\r\\nby 1991.\\r\\n    Revenue from jet engines was close to six billion dlrs last\\r\\nyear, with well over half of the business in the military\\r\\nsector, according to analysts estimates.\\r\\n    The rosy outlook for GEs jet engine business coincides\\r\\nwith an upbeat performance in other segments.\\r\\n    Heymann expects GE to earn 1.39 dlrs per share in the first\\r\\nquarter of 1987. Saying many will be suprised by the results,\\r\\nhe believes GE has shown through its acquisition of RCA Corp\\r\\nthat it has a unique ability to buy a major business and\\r\\nreshape it, pruning some parts and recombining parts with other\\r\\nelements of its 14 business areas.\\r\\n    Smith sees GE earning 1.35 dlrs per share in the current\\r\\nquarter.

Woolworth plans to open 650\\r\\nmore specialty stores in 1987. At this time last year, it\\r\\noperated 4,100 specialty stores, Garofalo said.\\r\\n    Garofalo said the largest specialty chain operated by\\r\\nWoolworth is Kinney Shoe Stores, followed by the Richman\\r\\napparel unit. Among other units are Little Folk Shop, a chain\\r\\nof discount childrens apparel stores; The Rx Place, a discount\\r\\ndrug, health and beauty aid operation; and Face Fantasies,\\r\\nwhich sells cosmetics. There are currently about 1,700\\r\\nWoolworth general merchandise stores operating worldwide, of\\r\\nwhich 1,200 are in the United States.\\r\\n    Harold Sells, chairman and chief executive of Woolworth,\\r\\nsaid in a statement, These results are especially gratifying as\\r\\nthey are an improvement over last years record earnings.\\r\\n    Sells that it was the fourth successive year earnings in\\r\\neach quarter improved over the corresponding year-earlier\\r\\nperiod.\\r\\n    Woolworths variety store operations were hard hit in the\\r\\n1970s and early 1980s by the quickly growing discount store\\r\\nindustry. In an attempt to compete in the 1970s, Woolworth\\r\\nopened a discount general store chain, Woolco, and J. Brannam,\\r\\na discount apparel chain. Both were failures in the United\\r\\nStates, although Woolco still operates in Canada.\\r\\n    In 1985, however, Woolworth changed its strategy and\\r\\nannounced that it would operate specialty stores. At that time,\\r\\nthe company said it would create 14 new groups of such stores.\\r\\nSpecialty stores generally have higher sales per square foot\\r\\nthan general merchandise stores.\\r\\n   \\r\\n Reuter\\r\\n&#3;\\',0\\r\\n\\'ROYAL RESOURCES CORP &lt;RRCO> 2ND QTR DEC 31 LOSS Shr loss 72 cts vs loss 1.48 dlrs\\r\\n    Net loss 4,466,006 vs loss 9,091,688\\r\\n    Revs 608,181 vs 1,280,727\\r\\n    Six Mths\\r\\n    Shr loss 77 cts vs loss 1.51 dlrs\\r\\n    Net loss 4,752,455 vs loss 9,265,457\\r\\n    Revs 1,444,149 vs 2,791,188\\r\\n   \\r\\n Reuter\\r\\n&#3;\\',0\\r\\n\\'CANADA ECONOMY EXPECTED TO GROW MODERATELY Canadian economic growth is expected to\\r\\nslow further in 1987, but an improved the trade picture should\\r\\nkeep the country from recession, economists said.\\r\\n    The economy is ready for about a 2.0 pct rate of growth\\r\\nover the course of 1987, said Carl Beigie, Chief Economist at\\r\\nDominion Securities Pitfield Ltd.\\r\\n    Statistics Canada reported that gross domestic product,\\r\\ngrew 3.1 pct in 1986, the fourth year of continuous expansion,\\r\\nbut down from 1985s four pct.\\r\\n    In the final quarter, GDP, in 1981 prices and at annualized\\r\\nrates, rose a slight 0.2 pct after expanding 0.8 pct in the\\r\\nthird quarter.\\r\\n    Essentially it is a flat performance, said Warren Jestin,\\r\\ndeputy chief economist at the Bank of Nova Scotia.\\r\\n    Economist Wendy Smith Cork of the brokerage Nesbitt Thomson\\r\\nBongard Inc said it shows the economy is not moving along very\\r\\nsteadily, its not a very promising number.\\r\\n    We werent surprised, we expected to see one bad quarter\\r\\nin Canada, but we dont think there will be a recession, she\\r\\nadded.\\r\\n    The rise in GDP was below the 3.3 pct increase forecast by\\r\\nFederal Finance Minister Michael Wilson in his budget last\\r\\nmonth.

Hutton said.\\r\\n    The next six weeks in the USSRs grain growing areas will\\r\\nbe the crucial period that will determine the final outcome of\\r\\nthe winter crops, Martell and other analysts said.\\r\\n    Where the crop is really made or broken is still ahead of\\r\\nus, an Agriculture Department authority on the USSR said.\\r\\n    The Soviet Union recently reported that nine mln hectares\\r\\nof winter grain will have to be reseeded due to winterkill.\\r\\nThis would be equal to about 25 pct of the total winter crop\\r\\nand would be the second highest winterkill in ten years, the\\r\\nUSDA analyst said.\\r\\n    With a timely spring, Soviet farmers would probably be able\\r\\nto reseed the damaged acreage with spring crops, but analysts\\r\\nnoted that spring crops normally yield lower than winter crops\\r\\n-- sometimes as much as 30-35 pct lower.\\r\\n    Normally winterkill is caused by inadequate snowcover\\r\\ncombined with cold temperatures. This winter, however,\\r\\nsnowcover in Soviet grain areas has generally been excellent,\\r\\nso the bulk of winterkill, analysts speculate, likely has been\\r\\ndue to a very dry fall and subsequent poor crop germination.\\r\\n    Fall dryness may be a problem. Theres a good correlation\\r\\nbetween mediocre crops and fall dryness, Martell said.\\r\\n    Precipitation last fall was as little as 25 pct of normal\\r\\nin southern and northern Ukraine, and below normal over the\\r\\nentire winter crop area, she said.\\r\\n    Recent cold temperatures in grain areas in which the\\r\\nsnowcover has been gradually melting could also have caused \\r\\nproblems of ice-crusting and winterkill, Jim Candor, senior\\r\\nforecaster for Accu Weather, said.\\r\\n    Livestock feed needs have probably increased because of the\\r\\nfall and winter, analysts said.

This compares with a target range of 120 to 140 cents\\r\\na lb under the system operating before quotas were suspended in\\r\\nFebruary last year following a sharp rise in international\\r\\nprices caused by drought damage to the Brazilian crop.\\r\\n    In a Reuter interview, Brazilian Coffee Institute, IBC,\\r\\nPresident Jorio Dauster urged producers not to panic and said\\r\\nthey need to make hard commercial decisions. If we have failed\\r\\nat the ICO, at least we have tried, Dauster said, adding now it\\r\\nis time to go and sell coffee.\\r\\n    But Brazil is keeping its marketing options open. It plans\\r\\nto make an official estimate of the forthcoming crop next\\r\\nmonth, Dauster said. It is too difficult to forecast now. Trade\\r\\nsources have put the crop at over 26 mln bags compared with a\\r\\nprevious crop of 11.2 mln. Brazil is defining details of public\\r\\nselling tenders for coffee bought on Londons futures market\\r\\nlast year.\\r\\n    A basic condition will be that it does not go back to the\\r\\nmarket in one go but is sold over a minimum of six months.\\r\\n    The breakdown of the ICO negotiations reflected a split\\r\\nbetween producers and consumers on how to set the yardstick for\\r\\nfuture quotas. Consumers said objective criteria like average\\r\\nexports and stocks should determine producer quota shares,\\r\\nDauster said.\\r\\n    All elements of this proposal were open to negotiation but\\r\\nconsumers insisted they did not want a return to the ad hoc way\\r\\nof settling export quotas by virtual horse trading amongst\\r\\nproducers whilst consumers waited in the corridors of the ICO.\\r\\n    Dauster said stocks and exports to ICO members and\\r\\nnon-members all need to be considered when setting quotas and\\r\\nthat Brazil would like to apply the coffee pact with a set\\r\\nratio of overall quota reflecting stock holdings.\\r\\n    It is a simplistic misconception that Brazil can dictate\\r\\npolicy to other producers. While consumer countries are welcome\\r\\nto participate they cannot dictate quotas which are very\\r\\ndifficult to allocate as different objective criteria achieve\\r\\ndifferent share-outs of quota, Dauster said.\\r\\n    Other delegates said there was more open talking at the ICO\\r\\nand at least differences were not hidden by a bad compromise.\\r\\n    Consumer delegates said they had not been prepared to\\r\\naccept the producers offer to abandon quotas if it proves\\r\\nimpossible to find an acceptable basis for them.\\r\\n    We want the basis of quotas to reflect availability and to\\r\\nencourage stock holding as an alternative to a buffer stock if\\r\\nsupplies are needed at a later stage, one delegate said.\\r\\n    Some consumers claimed producer support for the consumer\\r\\nargument was gaining momentum towards the end of the ICO\\r\\nsession but said it is uncertain whether this will now collapse\\r\\nand how much producers will sink their differences should\\r\\nprices fall further and remain depressed.\\r\\n    The ICO executive board meets here March 30 to April 1 but\\r\\nboth producer and consumer delegates said they doubt if real\\r\\nnegotiations will begin then. The board is due to meet in\\r\\nIndonesia in June with a full council scheduled for September.\\r\\n    More cynical traders said the pressure of market forces and\\r\\npolitics in debt heavy Latin American producer countries could\\r\\nbring ICO members back around the negotiating table sooner than\\r\\nmany imagine. In that case quotas could come into force during\\r\\nthe summer. But most delegates and traders said quotas before\\r\\nOctober are unlikely, while Brazils Dauster noted the ICO has\\r\\ncontinued although there were no quotas from 1972 to 1980.\\r\\n    A clear difference between the pressures already being felt\\r\\nby importers and exporters was that consumers would have been\\r\\nhappy to agree on a formula for future quotas even if it could\\r\\nnot be imposed now. At least in that way they said they could\\r\\nshow a direct relationship between quotas and availability.\\r\\n    In contrast producers wanted stop-gap quotas to plug the\\r\\nseemingly bottomless market and were prepared to allow these to\\r\\nlapse should lasting agreement not be found.\\r\\n    Producers were offering us jam tomorrow but after their\\r\\nfailure to discuss them last year promises were insufficient\\r\\nand we wanted a cast iron commitment now, one consumer said.\\r\\n Reuter\\r\\n&#3;\\',0\\r\\n\\' &#2;\\r\\nFEDERAL RESERVE WEEKLY REPORT 3 - FEB 26\\r\\n    One week ended Feb 25       daily avgs-mlns\\r\\n Govts bought outright....193,374 down....1,342\\r\\n Govts repurchases............nil unch.........\\r\\n Agencies bought outright...7,719 unch.........\\r\\n Agencies repurchases.........nil unch.........\\r\\n Acceptances repurchases......nil unch.........\\r\\n Matched sales..............4,920 vs......3,788\\r\\n Including sales with cust..4,369 vs......3,788\\r\\n Other Fed assets..........16,806 down....1,161\\r\\n Other Fed liabilities......6,421 up........178\\r\\n Other deposits with Fed......399 up.........26\\r\\n\\r\\n Reuter\\r\\n&#3;\\r\\n\\r\\n\\',0\\r\\n\\'SEAMAN FURNITURE &lt;SEAM> IN STOCK SPLIT Seaman Furniture Co Inc said\\r\\nits board declared a two-for-one split of the companys\\r\\noutstanding stock.\\r\\n    It said holders of its common will receive one additional\\r\\nshare for each share held as of March 20.

The disease was first discovered about six months ago.\\r\\n    Trade sources say prices might boom once again if the\\r\\ncrisis leads to output below the 1987 target of 143,000 tonnes.\\r\\nLast years output is estimated at between 133,000 and 135,000\\r\\ntonnes.\\r\\n    Researchers say the fungus could spread to other rubber\\r\\nclones if no immediate action is taken.\\r\\n    The RRI is considering asking estates to remove the trees\\r\\nseriously affected by the fungus because it was too late to use\\r\\nchemicals to kill the disease, an Institute spokesman said.\\r\\n    Senior industry and research officials met yesterday at\\r\\nPadukka, east of here, to discuss ways of controlling the\\r\\nfungus which is affecting estates mostly belonging to the State\\r\\nPlantations Corp and Janatha Estates Development Board.\\r\\n    The two state-owned groups account for 30 pct of rubber\\r\\nland with the balance belonging to small private producers with\\r\\na total of 145,600 hectares.\\r\\n    The RRIC 103 is a new clone propagated by the Research\\r\\nInstitute as high yielding and recommended two years ago for\\r\\nplanting. Only the two state groups seriously planted these\\r\\nclones while smallholders preferred the low-yielding but older\\r\\nPBX Malaysian clones.\\r\\n    Officials at yesterdays crisis meeting said it was decided\\r\\nto uproot only some of the affected trees while others would be\\r\\ntreated. They declined to comment on other decisions taken.\\r\\n    Trade sources said supplies had improved in the past week\\r\\nbut prices had hit their lowest since last December. If there\\r\\nis a shortage of rubber, prices are bound to rise, a spokesman\\r\\nfor a company buying on behalf of the Soviet Union said.\\r\\n    Rubber prices, particularly crepe, fell sharply by about\\r\\nfour rupees a kilo between December and March.

In each case,\\r\\nfarmers would have to undertake not to step up their capacity\\r\\nfor output of other products which are in surplus in the EC.\\r\\n    The sources said payment levels have not yet been fixed but\\r\\nwill be designed to compensate farmers for loss of profit on\\r\\nthe production they forego.\\r\\n    The sources said the package also contains provisions for\\r\\npayments to farmers who embark on a program aimed at protecting\\r\\nor improving the environment.\\r\\n    It would also mean compensatory allowances in less favoured\\r\\nfarming areas would be extended to crops. At present such\\r\\nallowances are available only for livestock.\\r\\n    The package would provide 20 mln Ecus for research into\\r\\nalternative farming techniques, the sources added.\\r\\n    At a news conference EC Farm Commissioner Frans Andriessen\\r\\nsaid the Commission is also working on proposals to enable the\\r\\nEC and member states to provide direct income supports for\\r\\nrelatively poor farmers.\\r\\n    Andriessen did not give full details, but said member state\\r\\naid would be subject to strict criteria to avoid distortion of\\r\\ncompetition.\\r\\n    EC payments would aim to help farmers to survive a\\r\\ndifficult period while the EC tackles the problems of surplus\\r\\nproduction.\\r\\n    The Commission withdrew from the package agreed last night\\r\\nproposals to pay early retirement pensions to farmers aged 55\\r\\nor over who gave up production.

The only guarantees recognised are those given by U.S.\\r\\nAnd U.K. Governments or, in the U.S., By domestic national\\r\\ngovernment agencies, the proposals showed.\\r\\n    The paper said the proposed rules would not cover spot\\r\\nforeign exchange contracts and securities traded in futures and\\r\\noptions exchanges.\\r\\n    It said U.S. Regulatory authorities and the Bank of England\\r\\nwere keen to encourage banks to net contracts -- consolidate\\r\\nmultiple contracts with the same counterparty into one single\\r\\nagreement to create one single payments stream.\\r\\n    It recognised that such arrangements may in certain\\r\\ncircumstances reduce credit risk and wish to encourage their\\r\\nfurther development and implementation, and said some of the\\r\\ncurrent proposals may be changed to take this into account.\\r\\n    The paper said the proposed rules would not cover spot\\r\\nforeign exchange contracts and securities traded in futures and\\r\\noptions exchanges.\\r\\n    It said U.S. Regulatory authorities and the Bank of England\\r\\nwere keen to encourage banks to net contracts -- consolidate\\r\\nmultiple contracts with the same counterparty into one single\\r\\nagreement to create one single payments stream.\\r\\n    It recognised that such arrangements may in certain\\r\\ncircumstances reduce credit risk and wish to encourage their\\r\\nfurther development and implementation, and said some of the\\r\\ncurrent proposals may be changed to take this into account.\\r\\n Reuter\\r\\n&#3;\\',0\\r\\n\\'PIEDMONT AVIATION &lt;PIE> BOARD TO MEET TODAY Piedmont Avaition Incs board of\\r\\ndirectors will conduct a special meeting beginning at 1400 est\\r\\ntoday, a Piedmont spokesman said.\\r\\n    The spokesman would not say what was on the agenda.\\r\\n    In mid-February, Piedmont said its board would meet to\\r\\ndiscuss all proposals to acquire the company.

The consumer position would have in effect reduced the\\r\\nmarket share of Brazil, by far the worlds largest producer.\\r\\n    Rosenbaum said the administration would continue to support\\r\\nlegislation now before Congress which would allow the U.S.\\r\\ncustoms service to monitor coffee imports, as a way to comply\\r\\nwith any future coffee quotas.\\r\\n    He said the Reagan administration would be reviewing the\\r\\ncoffee policy situation following the collapse of the London\\r\\ntalks, but nobody is proposing we change our position.\\r\\n    However, other U.S. government officials involved in coffee\\r\\npolicy said they are bracing for a diplomatic and coffee market\\r\\noffensive from producer countries, led by Brazil and Colombia,\\r\\nto soften the consumer position.\\r\\n    Knowing that its next crop is fairly large, Brazil will\\r\\nkind of want to test the resolve of other producers and\\r\\nconsumers, said one U.S. official.\\r\\n    The U.S. official, who asked not to be identified, said\\r\\nBrazil and Colombia may flood the coffee market in the next few\\r\\nmonths in an effort to drive down prices and pressure other\\r\\ncountries, particularly the splinter group of small producers\\r\\nwho differed with the major producers in London.\\r\\n    This in turn could lead to urgent appeals from Latin\\r\\nAmerican countries, faced with mounting debt problems, to the\\r\\nU.S. State department, and to the National Security Council in\\r\\nthe White House, for an easing of the U.S. position, U.S.\\r\\nofficials said.\\r\\n    The State department, a major player in setting U.S. coffee\\r\\npolicy, may then face conflicting pressures, particularly from\\r\\npolitically-sensitive U.S. allies in Central America, U.S.\\r\\nofficials said.\\r\\n    El Salvador and Guatemala both backed Brazil and Colombia\\r\\nat the London talks in resisting pressures for quotas based on\\r\\nobjective criteria. But the Dominican Republic and Costa Rica\\r\\njoined the splinter group, which said it would agree to\\r\\nobjective criteria.\\r\\n    There is a strong feeling among some in the State\\r\\nDepartment that the United States should continue to support\\r\\nthe splinter group of producers who have taken the\\r\\npolitically-risky step of opposing Brazil on the objective\\r\\ncriteria question, U.S. officials said.\\r\\n    Within the consuming countries there also is expected to be\\r\\nsome pressure to reassess positions.\\r\\n    In London, the U.S. was supported by the U.K., the\\r\\nNetherlands, West Germany, Japan, Australia and New Zealand on\\r\\nthe issue of objective criteria, U.S. officials said.\\r\\n    This bloc represented enough votes among consuming nations\\r\\nto successfully prevent adoption of the producer proposals.\\r\\n    However, U.S. sources said West Germanys support was at\\r\\ntimes qualified and there is some concern that the European\\r\\nCommunity could come under pressure to be more accommodative to\\r\\nproducers in future talks. France backed the Ivory Coast and\\r\\nother African producers during the talks.\\r\\n    A softening of the EC stance would make it more difficult,\\r\\nalthough not impossible, for the U.S. to block producer plans.\\r\\n    While political manuevering by small producers and\\r\\nconsuming countries will be important, U.S. officials said the\\r\\nkey to any future outcome will be Brazils position.\\r\\n    U.S. officials blamed Brazils intransigence for the\\r\\nfailure of the talks and said a more flexible position from\\r\\nBrasilia would be the most important step toward agreement.\\r\\n Reuter\\r\\n&#3;\\',0\\r\\n\\'INVESTORS HAVE 12.9 PCT OF EXOVIR &lt;XOVR> Mark Hammer, a private investor from\\r\\nMelville, N.Y., and members of his family told the Securities\\r\\nand Exchange Commission they have acquired a total of 375,200\\r\\nshares of Exovir Inc, or 12.9 pct of the total outstanding.\\r\\n    Hammer said his group has been accumulating Exovir stock\\r\\nsince Oct 28, 1985 for investment purposes and may buy more\\r\\nshares or sell all or part of his current stake.\\r\\n    While he said he has no intention of seeking control of the\\r\\ncompany, Hammer said that because of his extensive business\\r\\nexperience and his interest in Exovir stock, he may be\\r\\ninvited to become a member of the companys board.\\r\\n Reuter\\r\\n&#3;\\',0\\r\\n\\'TORRENTIAL RAINS HALT ARGENTINE GRAIN HARVEST Torrential rains throughout\\r\\nArgentinas grain-producing areas virtually paralysed coarse\\r\\ngrain harvesting in the week to yesterday, trade sources said.\\r\\n    Sunflower, maize and sorghum harvests were particularly\\r\\naffected, they said.

payments\\r\\ndeficit of 1.5 billion dlrs, well over target, but is taking\\r\\nsteps to improve its performance in this and other fields, Ali\\r\\nTigrel, director of economic planning at the State Planning\\r\\nOrganisation said.\\r\\n    He told Reuters the shortfall was a direct consequence of\\r\\neconomic growth of nearly eight pct, up from 5.1 pct in 1985,\\r\\nwhich he said resulted mostly from a surge in domestic demand.\\r\\n    Tigrel acknowledged a need to cut inflation further after a\\r\\ndrop of more than 12 points to 24.6 pct in the Treasury\\r\\nwholesale index last year.\\r\\n    This years target of 20 pct might be attainable but the\\r\\neconomic management will have to be careful, he said.\\r\\n    Tigrel, whose department produces the annual programme\\r\\nwhich is central to the governments economic planning, said\\r\\nTurkeys creditworthiness was at risk over the current account\\r\\nshortfall, originally targeted at 695 mln dlrs.\\r\\n    We must alleviate the current account substantially to\\r\\nsustain the creditworthiness that we have managed to secure\\r\\nover the last five years, he added.\\r\\n    His comment echoed last Octobers Organisation for Economic\\r\\nCooperation and Development report on Turkey, which said\\r\\nAnkaras case for more medium-term financing on better terms\\r\\nwould look better if inflation were lower and the current\\r\\naccount deficit cut or turned into a surplus.\\r\\n    In 1987 we must reduce the rate of growth in public sector\\r\\ninvestments, we must reduce the public sector deficit as a\\r\\npercentage of GNP and we must achieve a very visible\\r\\nimprovement in the current account deficit, he said.\\r\\n    Tigrel said a surge in public sector spending last year was\\r\\nalso to blame for the high deficits.\\r\\n    Appropriations to government departments had been cut by\\r\\neight pct since the budget was passed in December and foreign\\r\\nborrowing by municipalities had been restrained.\\r\\n    We are trying make sure that public bodies stick to the\\r\\ninvestment programme and do not exceed their appropriations, he\\r\\nsaid. It was hoped to bring the public sector borrowing\\r\\nrequirement down to five pct of GNP in 1987 from an estimated\\r\\n5.6 pct in 1986.\\r\\n    More modest GNP growth of five pct for 1987 was also\\r\\ntargeted, Tigrel said. Measures were being taken to encourage\\r\\nexports, and production incentives were being considered.\\r\\n    We must try to make sure that more capacity is injected\\r\\ninto the Turkish economy in the coming years. The promotion\\r\\npolicy is geared to make sure that both foreign investment and\\r\\nlocal private capital come more into play as far as\\r\\nmanufacturing capacity is concerned, Tigrel said.\\r\\n    He said the process of structural adjustment of the Turkish\\r\\neconomy to free market policies, begun in 1980, was still under\\r\\nway. Trade had been liberalised and a freer exchange rate\\r\\npolicy applied, but he acknowledged there was more to be done\\r\\nin a country where the state still dominates industry and the\\r\\ncurrency is only partially convertible.\\r\\n REUTER\\r\\n&#3;\\',0\\r\\n\\'ENERGY/CALIFORNIA OIL PRODUCTION Drilling for oil in California is\\r\\nlikely to continue at last years sharply reduced levels\\r\\ndespite recent gains in crude oil prices, industry analysts\\r\\nsaid.\\r\\n    Because much of the crude oil in California fields is\\r\\nthick, heavy and expensive to extract, oil prices would have to\\r\\nincrease to near 1985s levels before any significant recovery\\r\\nis seen in drilling, they said.\\r\\n    Companies will probably only drill their best prospects,\\r\\nsaid John Curti, an analyst with Birr Wilson Securities Inc.\\r\\n    Few new wells now are being drilled.\\r\\n    Only 33 rigs, about one-quarter of the total available,\\r\\nwere drilling for oil onshore in California last week, compared\\r\\nto about 70 last year, said Bill Bolster of Munger Oil\\r\\nInformation Services, which tracks California drilling\\r\\nactivity.\\r\\n    Its in the dregs right now, said Bolster of the states\\r\\ndrilling activity.\\r\\n    Current prices are not enough to justify increased\\r\\ndrilling, said Ed Malmgreen of the California Independent\\r\\nProducers Association.\\r\\n    While an Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries pact\\r\\nto curb production boosted oil prices early this year, prices\\r\\neventually fell.\\r\\n    Prices for Californias marker grade, Line 63 blend, have\\r\\nslumped about 20 pct in the last month to 14 dlrs from a high\\r\\nof about 17 dlrs.\\r\\n    More than half of Californias oil comes from stripper\\r\\nwells, those producing less than 10 barrels a day, and that\\r\\nmuch of that oil costs between 18 and 25 dlrs a barrel to\\r\\nextract, Malmgreen said.\\r\\n    Its not unusual for a stripper well to cost 18 dlrs,\\r\\nMalmgreen said.\\r\\n    Many stripper wells along the southern California coast\\r\\nproduce eight times as much water as crude oil, and inland\\r\\nwells frequently require the use of steam injection to spur\\r\\nextraction of the thick, heavy oil, he said.\\r\\n    The outlook for future production in California is clouded\\r\\nby a lack of exploratory drilling now, analysts said.\\r\\n    In the heart of Californias oil patch, Kern County, which\\r\\nproduces about two-thirds of the states oil, exploratory\\r\\ndrilling has slowed to a crawl.\\r\\n    Only 55 exploratory wells were drilled in Kern County in\\r\\n1986, compared to 137 in 1985, according to David Mitchell of\\r\\nthe state energy commission. So far this year only five\\r\\nexploratory wells have been drilled.\\r\\n    I dont think theyll even get to what they did last\\r\\nyear, Mitchell said.\\r\\n    No pickup in exploratory drilling is likely for the rest of\\r\\nthe decade, Mitchell said.\\r\\n    Along with the fall in drilling has come a decrease in the\\r\\nnumber of producing wells and overall production.\\r\\n    Between February and October of 1986, the number of\\r\\nproducing oil wells in California fell 14 pct to 43,521 from\\r\\nmore than 50,000, said Bill Guerard of the California Energy\\r\\nCommission.\\r\\n    In line with that decrease, Californias crude oil output\\r\\nfell about 10 pct last year due to low oil prices and is\\r\\nexpected to remain at that lower level, analysts said.\\r\\n    Between February and October 1986, Californias crude oil\\r\\nproduction slipped from an all-time high of 1.185 mln barrels\\r\\nper day to 1.066 mln bpd, Guerard said.\\r\\n    Total estimated crude oil

Analysts\\r\\nagreed that investors liked the repurchase program but they \\r\\ndiffered sharply over the carmakers long term prospects.\\r\\n    Im very positive on GM, said Jack Kirnan of Kidder\\r\\nPeabody and Co. Theyre clearly committed to enhancing\\r\\nshareholder value.\\r\\n    However, some analysts worry about how GM will pay for the\\r\\nbuyback and whether new models will enable the carmaker to\\r\\nrecapture lost market share.\\r\\n    After the market had closed yesterday, GM said it would buy\\r\\nback 20 pct of its common stock by the end of 1990. The\\r\\nannouncement sent investors today scrambling for GM shares,\\r\\nwith more than 3.2 mln shares changing hands by mid-day.\\r\\n    The buyback plan caused several analysts bullish on the\\r\\nstock to reiterate buy recommendations this morning, and at\\r\\nleast one increased his earnings estimates for GM based on a\\r\\ngood performance expected from new car models.\\r\\n    But David Healy of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc said the\\r\\nrepurchase program is not a positive.\\r\\n    The buyback doesnt really change the earnings outlook and\\r\\nputs more stress on the balance sheet, he said, since GM will\\r\\nhave to borrow money to pay for the stock purchases. The stock\\r\\nshould settle back down to around 76, he added.\\r\\n    Healy projects GM will earn five dlrs a share in 1987 and\\r\\n5.50 dlrs in 1988, compared to 1986 earnings of 8.21 dlrs.\\r\\nHealys numbers are near the low end of Wall Street estimates,\\r\\nwhich range from five dlrs to 7.80 dlrs in 1987 and from four\\r\\ndlrs to 10.80 dlrs in 1988.\\r\\n    Like other analysts, Healy sees GMs share of the domestic\\r\\ncar and truck market falling in 1987. On balance, GM cars are\\r\\nnot selling as well as their competitors, he said.\\r\\n    In late February, GM car sales fell 8.6 pct from the\\r\\nyear-ago period while competitors Ford Motor Co &lt;F> and\\r\\nChrysler Corp &lt;C> both posted increases. But GM said February\\r\\nsales showed improvement over January, adding that it expects\\r\\nimprovement in coming months.\\r\\n    Overall, GMs share of U.S. car and truck sales should fall\\r\\nto around 38 or 39 pct in 1987 from 41 pct at the end of 1986,\\r\\nanalysts said. The numbers include imports.\\r\\n    Kidder Peabodys Kirnan said cost reductions and product\\r\\nimprovements this year should lead to positive cash flow by the\\r\\nfourth quarter, which will help GM finance the buyback.\\r\\n    GM (stock) has been a real laggard and now its rolling up\\r\\nits sleeves and getting serious. I think theres a major\\r\\nearnings surprise in the winds, he said.\\r\\n    Kirnan raised his earnings estimates slightly today, in\\r\\npart in reaction to the announced buyback, and sees GM earning\\r\\n5.65 dlrs this year and 9.75 dlrs in 1988. The company is more\\r\\nconcerned than ever about improving their relative valuation\\r\\nwith respect to Ford and Chrysler, he said.\\r\\n    Another positive for the stock is GMs dividend, currently\\r\\nfive dlrs a share annually, which gives it a higher yield than\\r\\nits competitors, Kirnan said. And GM will raise the cash\\r\\ndividend 25 to 50 cts a share next year, he predicted.\\r\\n    But analyst Michael Lucky of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc\\r\\nsaid U.S. car sales will weaken, and GMs new products, if\\r\\nsuccessful, will only slow but not halt the erosion of its\\r\\nmarket share.\\r\\n    I believe their new cars will be successful, but that will\\r\\nonly curtail losses in market share, which will fall to around\\r\\n35 pct by 1990, Lucky said.\\r\\n    Philip Fricke of Goldman Sachs and Co falls in the middle\\r\\nof the bulls and bears. While he is recommending GM stock, he\\r\\nsaid results will not improve until 1988.\\r\\n    Im not looking for improvement this year. This is a\\r\\ntransition year for GM, he said.\\r\\n    Fricke, who estimates 1987 earnings at 7.80 dlrs and 1988\\r\\nat 10.80 dlrs, said cost cutting and new car models will not\\r\\naffect 1987 results.

While no firm figures exist, dealers in\\r\\neurobonds estimate that 80 pct of all new issues are involved\\r\\nin some swap arrangement. Separately, the ISDA estimates that\\r\\nabout 300 billion dlrs worth of swap transactions are\\r\\noutstanding. Kenneth McCormick, co-chairman of the\\r\\nInternational Swap Dealers Association (ISDA) and President of\\r\\nKleinwort Benson Cross Financing Inc, said that the Association\\r\\nhas no comment and will study the proposals.\\r\\n    What they are proposing is really double counting, Patrick\\r\\nde Saint-Aignan, managing director of swaps for Morgan Stanley\\r\\nand Co, said. Instead, he argues, banks should either be\\r\\nrequired to hold a percentage of the face value -- say one pct\\r\\nper year to maturity -- or to hold a percentage of the cost of\\r\\nreplacing the contract in the event of a counterparty default.\\r\\n    The potential risk factors are very large relative to what\\r\\nwe had expected, said a director at one U.K. merchant bank.\\r\\nWhat they are really doing is asking you to capitalize now --\\r\\nto borrow money now -- to cushion you against risk you might\\r\\nhave 10 years from now, he added.(Adds title first paragraph).\\r\\n    Dealers also said they believe that banks not covered by\\r\\nthe agreement, such as those based in Japan, will have a\\r\\ncompetitive advantage because they will not have to pass the\\r\\ncosts on to customers.\\r\\n    Indeed, regulators are apparently also concerned about the\\r\\nexclusion of other countries from the new requirements. Federal\\r\\nReserve Board Governor Martha Seger, following approval of the\\r\\nproposed guidelines by the Fed, said she is concerned that\\r\\nJapan was not involved in the U.K.-U.S. effort to draft new\\r\\ncapital rules.\\r\\n     Dealers said they were somewhat relieved to see that bank\\r\\nregulators recognized the concept of netting, that is,\\r\\noffsetting the amounts receiveable from and payable to a single\\r\\ncounterparty against each other.\\r\\n    The paper said that regulatory authorities recognize that\\r\\nsuch arrangements (netting) may in certain circumstances reduce\\r\\ncredit risk. Furthermore, the paper said, if a netting\\r\\nagreement could be reached that would withstand legal tests, it\\r\\nmight be willing to reduce capital requirements accordingly.\\r\\n    But dealers said they fear regulators may insist on an\\r\\nairtight netting agreement that is impossible to design.\\r\\n     One problem is that there has never been a major default\\r\\nin the swaps market.

The TWA offer was announced shortly\\r\\nafter the Piedmont board meeting was scheduled to begin.\\r\\n    TWA offered to buy USAir for 52 dlrs cash per share. It\\r\\nalso said it was the largest shareholder of USAir and\\r\\nthreatened to go directly to USAir shareholders with an offer\\r\\nfor 51 pct of the stock at a lower price.\\r\\n    TWA also said it believed its offer was a better deal for\\r\\nUSAir shareholders than an acquisition of Piedmont, but it said\\r\\nit alternatively would discuss a three-way combination of the\\r\\nairlines.\\r\\n    Market sources and analysts speculated that TWA chairman\\r\\nCarl Icahn made the offer in order to put his own airline into\\r\\nthe takeover arena.\\r\\n    Were just wondering if hes not just trying to get TWA\\r\\ninto play. Theres speculation on the street he just wants to\\r\\nmove onto somthing else, said one arbitrager. We think TWA\\r\\nmight just be putting up a trial balloon.\\r\\n    Analysts said the offer must be taken seriously by USAir,\\r\\nbut that the airline will probably reject it because the price\\r\\nis relatively low compared to other airline deals.\\r\\n    They also said Icahn must prove his offer credible by\\r\\nrevealing financing arrangements. They need to show their\\r\\ncommitment and their ability to finance. I think its a\\r\\ncredible offer, said Timothy Pettee, a Bear Stearns analyst.\\r\\n    I think its certainly on the low end of relative values\\r\\nof airline deals, said Pettee. Pettee estimated 58 dlrs would\\r\\nbe in a more reasonable range based on other airline mergers.\\r\\n    USAir stock soared after TWA made public its offer. A\\r\\nspokesman for USAir declined comment, and said USAir had not\\r\\nchanged its offer for Piedmont. USAir offered of buy 50 pct of\\r\\nthat airlines stock for 71 dlrs cash per share and the balance\\r\\nfor 73 dlrs per share in USAir stock.\\r\\n    USAir closed up 5-3/8 at 49-1/8 on volume of 1.9 mln\\r\\nshares.\\r\\n    Piedmont, which slipped 1/2 to close at 69-5/8, also\\r\\nremained silent on the TWA action. Piedmont has an outstanding\\r\\n65 dlr cash per share offer from Norfolk Southern Corp.\\r\\n    Norfolk Southern declined comment, but said it stuck with\\r\\nits offer for Piedmont. Norfolk owns about 20 pct of Piedmont\\r\\nand opened the bidding when it said it would propose a takeover\\r\\nof Piedmont.\\r\\n    Some analysts said Icahn may be trying to acquire USAir to\\r\\nmake his own airline a more attractive takeover target.\\r\\n    Icahn I think had wanted to sell his airline and there\\r\\nwere no takers. I think the strategy might have called for\\r\\nmaking his investment more attractive. One way to accomplish\\r\\nthat specific objective is to go out and acquire other\\r\\nairlines, said Andrew Kim of Eberstadt Fleming.\\r\\n    I dont know whose going to buy them, but at least this\\r\\nway it becomes a much more viable package, said Kim.\\r\\n    But Icahns financing ability for such a transaction\\r\\nremains in doubt, in part because of TWAs heavy debt load.\\r\\n    Wall street sources said TWA has some cash with which to do\\r\\nthe offer.\\r\\n    The sources said Icahn has not lined up outside financial\\r\\nadvisers and plans to make his own arrangements.\\r\\n   Icahn earlier this year abandoned plans to buy USX Corp &lt;X>\\r\\nand still retains 11 pct of that companys stock.\\r\\n    Some Wall street sources said the financiers USX plan was\\r\\nimpacted by the cloud hanging over his adviser, Drexel Burnham\\r\\nLambert Inc, because of Wall Streets insider trading scandal.\\r\\n    Industry sources also predicted USAir might reject the TWA\\r\\noffer on price and financing concerns. Its littered with\\r\\ncontingencies and it doesnt even have a financing\\r\\narrangement, said one executive at another major airline.\\r\\n    But the executive conceded a merged TWA-USAir would be a\\r\\nstrong contender with USAirs east coast route system and\\r\\nplanned west coast presence from PSA. USAir could feed the\\r\\nintenrational flights of TWA, which has a midwest presence in\\r\\nits St. Louis hub. Adding Piedmont, dominant in the southeast,\\r\\nto the mix would develop an even stronger force.\\r\\n    The combined entity would also have TWAs pars reservation\\r\\nsystem.\\r\\n    Such a merger would be complex and analysts said it would\\r\\nresult in an airline iwth an 18 pct market share.\\r\\n   \\r\\n Reuter\\r\\n&#3;\\',0\\r\\n\\'FOREST OIL CORP &lt;FOIL> 4TH QTR Shr loss 29 cts vs profit eight cts\\r\\n    Net loss 2.0 mln vs profit 568,000\\r\\n    year\\r\\n    Shr loss 1.37 dlrs vs profit 88 cts\\r\\n    Net loss 9.3 mln vs profit 6.0 mln\\r\\n Reuter\\r\\n&#3;\\',0\\r\\n\\'YEUTTER PLANS TRADE TRIP TO CHINA THIS SUMMER U.S. Trade Representative Clayton\\r\\nYeutter said he plans a July trip to China to discuss trade\\r\\nissues including Chinas admission to the General Agreements on\\r\\nTariffs and Trade.\\r\\n    Yeutter told a congressional hearing it was possible China\\r\\ncould be a member of GATT before the end of the year.\\r\\n    They are making major moves to becoming a full scale member\\r\\nof the world economy, he told the House Appropriations\\r\\nsubcommittee which oversees his agencys budget.\\r\\n    Depending on how the negotiations go on the terms of\\r\\nChinas GATT membership, Yeutter said he could put the final\\r\\ntouches on the U.S. part of the agreement during his trip.    \\r\\nThe admission of China to GATT, which is the multinational\\r\\ngroup of nations which negotiates international rules on trade,\\r\\nwould offer both potential export markets and potential\\r\\ncompetition for U.S. industries, he said.\\r\\n    That has a lot of potential as well as risks for U.S.\\r\\nbusiness, Yeutter said.\\r\\n    I think China will develop into a fine market for us, he\\r\\nadded.\\r\\n Reuter\\r\\n&#3;\\',0\\r\\n\\'IDB COMMUNICATIONS GROUP INC &lt;IDBX> YEAR NET Period ended December 31.\\r\\n    Shr 25 cts vs 20 cts\\r\\n    Net 801,000 vs 703,000\\r\\n    Revs 6,318,000 vs 3,926,000\\r\\n Reuter\\r\\n&#3;\\',0\\r\\n\\'RIO COFFEE TRADE PREFERS NO PACT TO QUOTA CUT The failure of talks to introduce\\r\\nnew coffee export quotas within the International Coffee\\r\\nAgreement, ICA, was preferable to the alternative of Brazil\\r\\nhaving a sharply reduced quota, as had been proposed, President\\r\\nof the Rio de Janeiro Coffee Trade Association Carlos Calmon\\r\\nsaid.\\r\\n    He told Reuters proposals to reduce Brazils quota to 25\\r\\npct of the world share from 30 pct at present were unacceptable\\r\\nas the country has large stocks and a good harvest is expected.\\r\\n    Brazil has the capacity to export 20 mln bags this year,\\r\\nCalmon added.\\r\\n    Calmon said, assuming a 58 mln bag global ICA quota,\\r\\nBrazils share under the proposals would have been 14.5 mln\\r\\nbags, of which soluble would have accounted for 2.0 mln,\\r\\nleaving just 12.5 mln bags of green coffee for export.\\r\\n    Its a pity the talks broke down, but for Brazil this was\\r\\nbetter than such a quota reduction, he added.\\r\\n    In 1985 Brazil exported 19.6 mln bags of soluble and green\\r\\ncoffee, including about two mln bags to non-members.
